"""Hamr — which harness wears this errand, and the exact line that launches it.

The engine owns the *choice* and the *line*; it does not own how a harness
behaves (that is `bin/fleet/hamr-harness.sh` and the harness itself). Resolution is
the machine's, never a repo template's, and the provenance is always named:

  1. an explicit flag                      → "explicit flag"
  2. `config/eindri-harness`               → "config/eindri-harness (this machine)"
  3. the fleet law                         → local model → pi · hosted → opencode

A harness outside `VERIFIED` is refused unless the caller supplies a raw launch
command (a harness value containing whitespace) — the deliberate escape hatch the
old door already has, kept so a new adapter can be trialled without a code change.
