# The well — recall and remember

## What it is

**Mimirsbrunn** is Ymir's long‑term memory — the well. It is one store, in the hoard,
that remembers what happened and hands it back when it matters: **drink before you
act, water it after.** Every session can recall decisions, and record what it learned,
so the next session starts smarter than the last.

## What you need

- Ymir installed. The memory engine (engram) is provisioned by the installer /
  `bin/engine/prereq-ensure.sh engram`.

## Do it

```bash
# is the well reachable?
bin/records/mimir.sh health
```

**Recall** — ask before you act:

```bash
bin/records/mimir.sh recall "why did we stop using the old model rail" --k 5
bin/records/mimir.sh recall "vault key design" --mode hybrid   # hybrid | cosine | spreading
```

**Record** — water it after:

```bash
bin/records/mimir.sh observe "Mjollnir never force-merges; Glitnir holds the seal" \
    --tags mjollnir,gate --store semantic --shape decision --task "delivery gate"
```

**The gate says no, sometimes.** Before anything is stored the well asks three
questions: does this change future behaviour, is it a commitment with consequences,
or is it a decision with rationale? If none of the three, the write is **dropped**
and you are told why. That is the feature, not a failure — a memory that keeps
everything cannot be trusted about anything. State which question you are answering
with `--shape behaviour|commitment|decision`, and which shelf it belongs to with
`--store episodic|semantic|procedural`. Secrets are refused outright, and the vault
never enters the well.

**Ask a narrower question** — pick the shelf and the window before you search:

```bash
bin/records/mimir.sh recall "why the write gate" --store semantic --since 2026-10-01
bin/records/mimir.sh recall "smoke test" --tag domain:smoke --k 8
bin/records/mimir.sh recall "the shelf rule" --task "memory policy"   # what this work taught
```

**Correct and retract** — append, never overwrite:

```bash
bin/records/mimir.sh correct <episode-id> "the gate asks three questions, and dedupes first"
bin/records/mimir.sh retract <episode-id> --why "that script moved to bin/smoke_test.sh"
bin/records/mimir.sh why <episode-id>        # the chain, both ways
```

The original stays in the record, annotated void, and recall stops handing it back as
fact. Nothing is ever deleted (Rule 20).

**Let memory forget** — grading, nightly and on demand:

```bash
bin/records/mimir.sh grade            # report: nýr · eldri · forn · safn, and overlaps
bin/records/mimir.sh grade --apply    # decay, annotate duplicates, archive expired, move superseded docs
```

**Is the memory healthy?** — one row: size, last observe, last recall, last daily
entry, last grading run. Eir carries it as the `memory` surface.

```bash
bin/records/mimir.sh memory            # the whole picture
bin/records/mimir.sh memory --line     # one line (what Eir prints)
```

**Walk the timeline** — a thing's history, in order:

```bash
bin/records/mimir.sh timeline --entity vault
```

### The bridge (so agents can recurse)

The engine lives behind a bridge on `:4602`; agents reach it as the `engram` MCP
(recall/observe) rather than shelling out:

```bash
bin/bridge/mimir-bridge.sh --start     # raise the bridge
```

## Notes and limits

- **One well, and it lives in the hoard.** The store is
  `$YMIR_HOME/hodd/memory/kaia.engram` — never in the code tree (Rule 04). Everything
  resolves it through `bin/vault/hoard-lib.sh`.
- **The gate is not advisory.** A dropped write is a normal answer; observe exits 3
  and prints the reason. `--force` bypasses the three questions only, and the record
  shows it was forced. Secrets and confidential material cannot be forced past.
- **Grading never lowers the count.** It annotates and moves; a run that loses an
  episode is reported as a failure. Near-duplicate consolidation is proposed, not
  performed — merging two memories by machine makes a new, invented one.
- **The nightly pass needs a backup first.** `--apply` runs in Nornir's memory job
  only after that night's snapshot succeeded; without it the pass reports only.
- **Recall is not authority.** The well returns what was *recorded*; if it conflicts
  with the code or the operator, the code and the operator win. The well is memory,
  not law.
- **Nothing confidential is watered in.** Vault content never enters the well (Rule 15)
  — a confidential session points `ENGRAM_DB` at the session, not the well (Rule 16).
- With the bridge up, agents should prefer the MCP tools; `mimir.sh` is the same well
  from the shell.

## If it does not work

| What you see | What to do |
|---|---|
| `health` fails | Raise the bridge: `bin/bridge/mimir-bridge.sh --start`; check the engine is provisioned with `bin/engine/prereq-ensure.sh status`. |
| Recall returns nothing | The well is young, or nothing matched — observe a few facts first, or widen `--k`. If you passed `--store`/`--tag`/`--since`, the slice may be empty: retry without the filter to see which. |
| `observe` exits 3 and says "dropped" | The gate refused it. Say which question it answers (`--shape`) or make it a real lesson; a write that commits to nothing is not memory. |
| `memory` says "grading has never run" | `bin/records/mimir.sh grade --apply` (it may also be Eir's `memory` surface, mended with `bin/agents/eir-doctor.sh fix`). |
| An agent cannot recall | The `engram` MCP is not wired for its harness — re‑run the memory surface: `bin/agents/eir-doctor.sh fix` (the `well`/`mcp` surfaces). |
