# The wards — the delivery gate

## What it is

The **wards** are Ymir's tree gates. Before a change leaves a machine, the wards judge
it non‑zero‑or‑nothing: a secret, a private path, a guessed default, a broken schedule,
an uncatalogued page, a copied vault file, an out‑of‑vault write, dead code — each has
a ward, and any hit **refuses the push**. They run in the pre‑push hook **and** in CI,
so the gate is the same on every machine.

## What you need

- Nothing extra. The wards are scripts under `bin/gates/guards/` and run with the shell.

## Do it

```bash
# every ward, on this tree
bin/gates/guards.sh

# just the names
bin/gates/guards.sh --list
```

You will get one row per ward — `PASS`, or `FAIL` with the finding:

```
guards[7]{ward,status,finding}:
  "runtime-guard","PASS",""
  "defaults-guard","PASS",""
  "cron-guard","PASS",""
  "features-guard","PASS",""
  "vault-guard","PASS",""
  "confidential-guard","PASS",""
  "dead-code-guard","PASS",""
```

Run a single ward directly when you want its detail:

```bash
bin/gates/guards/defaults-guard.sh check     # one ward, full findings
bin/gates/guards/secret-guard.sh --all       # every tracked file, once
bin/gates/guards/private-guard.sh --all
```

Wards also run themselves:

- **`bin/gates/guards.sh`** — the pre‑push hook and both CI hosts call it; a fault
  stops the push.
- **pre‑commit** — `secret-guard --install` seats the repo hook (public, docs, private,
  vault, confidential, secret); `hoard-guard --install` seats the home's. Git runs them
  on every commit, including the hasty ones.

## The wards

| Ward | What it refuses |
|---|---|
| `runtime-guard` | the tree becoming a runtime |
| `defaults-guard` | a guessed home/default (Rule 07) |
| `cron-guard` | a cron job naming a script that does not ship |
| `features-guard` | a `docs/features/` page not in `FEATURES.md` (Rule 14) |
| `vault-guard` | a file copying the open vault verbatim (Rule 15) |
| `confidential-guard` | a commit outside the vault during a session (Rule 16) |
| `dead-code-guard` | an unreached file, function, branch or constant (Rule 17) |
| `secret-guard` · `private-guard` · `public-guard` · `docs-guard` | a credential, a private path, a live secret shape, a private doc under `docs/` |
| `branch-guard` | a push to a protected branch |
| `fixes-guard` | a push range with no fix note |

## Notes and limits

- **A gate that does not say why is an obstacle.** Every ward prints the finding and
  the remedy; read the `help:` line.
- **The gate is not a formality.** A `FAIL` means the change does not leave — fix the
  cause, don't bypass it. The one loud override is `YMIR_SKIP_FIXES_GUARD=1` for the
  fix‑note ward; everything else has no bypass by design.
- **Never push to a protected branch.** Delivery is a **PR** (Rule 08); the ward makes
  a direct push impossible.

## If it does not work

| What you see | What to do |
|---|---|
| A ward `FAIL`s on push | Read its remedy; fix the cause. `bin/gates/guards/<ward>.sh check` shows the detail. |
| `fixes-guard: no fix note in this range` | Add a note under `docs/fixes/<component>/` for THIS push range (`bin/gates/fixes.sh record --component=…`). |
| A pre‑commit refuses | The same wards run on commit — fix it before committing, or you are committing a leak. |
| CI fails but the push passed | CI runs the same `guards.sh`; the difference is the tree — re‑run it locally and read the FAIL. |
