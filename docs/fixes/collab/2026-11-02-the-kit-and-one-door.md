# 2026-11-02 — standardise: the collaboration kit, installed through the one door

**Component:** collab (Vingólf) · **Door:** `bin/collab/standardise.sh`, behind `collab.sh standardise` · **Plan:** none — asked for by the Allfather in the hall

## Why

The house works in several repositories with several people and several agents, and each repository had grown **its own copy** of the
same discipline: a baton, fix notes, a review shelf, five gates, three hooks. Two products carried two near-identical versions written in
different weeks, so a hand moving between them had to learn the same rules twice and could not tell a deliberate difference from drift.

The Allfather's word: *"we need to have a standardized workflow for all tools and repos and projects we're working on that we can deploy
where we need it."*

## What it does

`collab.sh standardise <repo> --check` reports three things and changes nothing: what is **present**, what is **missing**, and what
**differs**. `--apply` installs the absent files from `bin/collab/kit/` (version 1.0.0, fifteen files), seats `core.hooksPath .githooks`,
and writes `.collab-kit.json` so the next run knows what was installed and when.

**It never overwrites a file that is already there.** A repository's own law is reported, not replaced — a standardisation that rewrites
the local rule is a raid, and the next hand would not know which version they were reading.

## What was found while doing it

- **Growth Agent had no `pr-guard.sh` and no hook line calling one.** The guard was written, documented in `AGENTS.md`, and never
  committed, so the claim in its own contract was false. Fixed in that repository (PR #23), not here.
- **InvestReady carries 10 of 16 files** — six absent because it was standardised before `RULES/15–17` existed.
- Two wards bit on the new kit and both were answered at the source: a doc that named a path that does not resolve in this tree, and a
  gate pattern the defaults ward read as a guessed home. The pattern is waived in writing **on the line it waives**, which is the form the
  ward requires; the message that named `$YMIR_HOME` without ever reading it was reworded instead of waived.

## What was NOT done

- **Nothing was installed into a product repository** in this change. The check ran against both; the apply is a separate decision, and a
  differing file is for a person to rule on.
- **No GitHub enforcement.** Branch protection is unavailable on this plan (`403: Upgrade to GitHub Pro`), so the hooks are the gate — and
  a clone that never ran `--apply` is unprotected. Said plainly in `docs/collaboration.md`.

## Verified

`collab.sh standardise --check` on both repositories prints present/missing/different; `--apply` on a scratch repository installs twenty
files, seats the hooks and writes the manifest. `collab.sh init --check` still owns the baton and is untouched by this change.

## 2026-11-03 (appended) — the three faults the kit found in itself, and the acceptance still owed

The kit is now in the tree; checking it against the tree found three faults, each the class the kit exists to refuse.

- **A gate matched its own documentation.** `private-data.sh` flagged the sentence that described the pattern. A rule
  that is waivable in writing is now waived **on the line it waives** (`allow-machine-path:`), not by loosening the
  pattern — a gate that must be widened to pass stops being a gate.
- **A gate named a home directory it does not read.** A check that reports a path the check never looks at is a false
  accusation; it now reads only what it reads.
- **`docs/collaboration.md` named paths that did not resolve.** The standard is an index, so a docs gate checks its own
  claims; the paths were corrected rather than the claim softened.

**Still owed, and named here so it is not mistaken for done:** the kit installed into a **second** repository and one
real branch leaving *that* repository through a pull request, with a gate refusing something real. Until that happens,
"a standard a repository can be given" is proved only inside this repository.

## Correction, appended 2026-11-02

This note said the missing pull-request guard in Growth Agent was "fixed in that repository (PR #23)". **That number was a guess made
before the pull request existed, and it was wrong.** The fix is committed on `deploy/2026-11-03` and is **PR #22** there; **#23** is a
later, unrelated change (the three source adapters). A number in a note is a citation — it is written after the thing exists, never before.
