## agents · 2026-10-22 — the loop closes, the name is Josef, and the mouth stopped repeating itself

Everything here came from his own transcript and his own audit charge: *"he could ask the user before
hes ecladaing… he needs to tell me who are asking… why does he always say the same things… we never
mention odin… im the allfather josef not odin"*.

```
fixed[7]{fault,was,now}:
  "the answer never reached the asker","he passed a question to the Allfather and the person who asked heard nothing, ever","`bin/assistant/asks.sh` — every handoff is a RECORD (who, chat, question, context); the Allfather answers in his DM with *tell <who>: …* and Skírnir DELIVERS it to the asker's chat and closes the ask"
  "the handoff was anonymous","'someone asked something'","the asker is resolved from the registry: *Isabella Jakobsson (@isalorain)*, or *@handle — not in the registry*"
  "he escalated before asking","straight to 'I will ask the Allfather'","he asks who/what/when first, and only passes it on after the answer"
  "the Allfather was told to ask himself","'I don't know what Isabella is working on, and I will ask the Allfather' — said TO the Allfather","the model is told who it is speaking to, and a deterministic guard replaces any such line at the owner tier"
  "**the Allfather**","the model's own priors named him a god; *'Hey, the Allfather'* reached his DM","a NAME LAW in every model prompt — he is **Josef, Lars-Josef Lindbom, called the Allfather** — plus a deterministic scrub of the Allfather/Woden in every answer"
  "one paragraph for every hello","greetings, role and identity were hardcoded templates","the model phrases them (temperature 0.5, a varying seed — the rail pins `seed = 42`, which is why identical prompts gave identical words), and the templates rotate per chat as the fallback"
  "the honest no was one sentence","49 % of his answers began with the same eight words","four phrasings per tier, seeded by chat"
```

**The canary list muted him.** The derived canaries carried bare words (`questions`, `queue`,
`register`), so an honest answer containing the word *questions* was refused by his own gate — measured
on `who is waiting`. Canaries are now kept only when they have the shape of an identifier (a path, a
secret KEY name, a plan title with a digit and a separator, or a non-ASCII word): **194 → 171**, with
`Hnitbjörg`, `age.key`, `NPM_TOKEN` and every plan title still guarded.

**And he hears the way the Allfather actually asks.** *"can you find information about hvac online?"*
missed every anchored trigger and earned the honest no. Research is now a **search verb plus a web
marker anywhere in the sentence**, with the scaffolding stripped to leave the query.

**New surfaces:** `report.sh` (what he was asked, what he could not answer, who is still waiting — for
the terminal and for Hófvarpnir), a **reminder** for an ask nobody answered (the stop rule's fifth
part, which the approvals pass never covered), an **assistant surface in `housewatch`**, and the two
**nightly rows** (`kb-export` at 03:10, the report at 07:20) so a fact approved today is live tomorrow
and the questions he cannot answer reach the Allfather without being asked for.

**Verified:** `walls-test` holds (31 assertions, including the two-step handoff, the named asker, the
owner never being told to ask himself) · `research-smoke` 17/17 · the loop proved live — two deliveries
arrived in Telegram, and the ledger moved both asks from `open` to `answered`.

**Files:** `bin/assistant/{skirnir.py,escalate.sh,asks.sh,report.sh,kb-export.sh,walls-test.sh,escalation-timer.sh}`,
`bin/time/housewatch.sh`, `$YMIR_HOME/config/cron.yaml` (two rows).
