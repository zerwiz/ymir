## snotra · 2026-10-23 — the letter is designed, and every value in it still comes from the record

### Files
- `bin/time/snotra/snotra-letter.py` — `letter_html()` rebuilt to the Allfather's design
- `docs/snotra/the-letters.md` (the design section, later this pass)

### What changed
The Allfather supplied a full page design — a dark header band, a three-figure summary bar, grade chips
(A red · B amber · C grey), question cards, an "assignee / open actions" table, an attachments grid, the ask
in a rule-bordered callout, a next-meeting card, and a signed footer. It is now **the** letter, generated from
the record:

| part of the design | where its values come from |
|---|---|
| header: company · title · date · participants | `meeting.company` (resolved to the display name in `companies.yaml`) · `title` · `started_at` · `participants[present]` |
| summary bar (14 · 4 · 3) | the record's own counts — never typed |
| grade chips + legend | `decisions[].grade`, ordered A → B → C |
| question cards | `questions[].question`, with `asked_by` when the record names one |
| assignee / open actions | `actions[].owner`, counted — the record's owners, nothing inferred |
| attachments grid | **only the files the draft actually carries**, labelled by extension |
| the ask | the record's confirmation action, quoted, with its id, owner, `definition_of_done` and due date |
| the note | the record's risk mitigation, verbatim, with its `RSK-…` id |
| "how to answer" | the letter's own instruction (confirm / `objection: …`), naming the id rule the watcher uses |
| next meeting | the place's cadence (Monday + `monday_at`), marked **proposed** |
| footer | `roles.operator` as the signer, the company, the mailbox |

**No sentence in it is new.** The two lines that are ours — "how to answer" and the footer — are instructions
about the letter itself, not claims about the meeting.

The two partner drafts carry the same design and stay unsent until his word.
