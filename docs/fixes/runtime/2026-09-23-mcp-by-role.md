## runtime · unversioned · 2026-09-23 — MCP config by role (plan 51 Phase 3)

### Why
- **Problem:** `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json` hardcoded **literal LAN IPs**
  (`bolthorn`/`skuld` at `192.168.68.111`), hand-edited per machine. A synced
  config naming one machine's LAN address is the same trap family as the lock
  pointer; and if the heart moved, every body broke.
- **Fix:** `bin/mcp-config.sh` **generates** the harness MCP config from the
  machine's role:
  - The record servers — **well/engram** (`:8317`), **skills/bolthorn** (`:8319`),
  **tickets/skuld** (`:8320`) — live on the **heart**.
  - A **body** addresses them by the heart's **tailnet** (or LAN) name from the
    registry; the **heart itself** uses `127.0.0.1`.
  - **firecrawl** stays local (stdio).
  - `show` prints the JSON; `write` writes `$HOME/.pi/agent/mcp.json` (with a
    backup). Ports are env-overridable (Rule 07).

### Verified
- `.agents/tests/mcp-config.test.sh` — **ALL PASS**: a dev body's well/tickets
  point at the heart's tailnet; the heart uses loopback and never self-addresses;
  the config parses; a missing registry falls back to loopback, no crash.
- On this box (dev): `well → http://whynot.tailefab81.ts.net:8317/mcp`.
