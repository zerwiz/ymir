# The mirror had no door — the documents were written and never read

**Date:** 2026-11-02 · **Component:** gimle

## What was wrong

The one sync that exists, `gimle-mirror.timer`, copies eight named documents from Growth Agent into
`~/gimle/desk/data/docs/growth-agent/` every hour and reports `mirrored 9 files`. Nothing served that
directory. Asking the hall for a mirrored file returned **200 with the login page** — the SPA fallback
answering for a path that does not exist on its own root. So the synchronization ran, proved itself in the
journal, and produced files **no person could read**: the greenest possible nothing (Rule 37).

## What changed

`bin/gimle/desk.py` gains the door the desk should always have had: **`/desk/docs/<project>/<file>`**, served
from `<data>/docs/<project>/`, through the same membership rule as the record.

- `places_for()` decides, unchanged — `None` for the operator (named by `GIMLE_OPERATOR`), a list of places for
  anyone else, and nobody else sees anything (default deny).
- `may_read_doc()` matches the project against those places, so a person who may not see a place may not read
  its mirrored documents either. The mirror is not a side channel around the record.
- `doc_path()` accepts only a flat file name with one of three suffixes (`md`, `html`, `txt`), refuses
  separators, a leading dot and any traversal, and re-checks the resolved path is inside the project's own
  directory. A traversal that slips through the URL decoder is still a `404`.

## Measured

Run locally against a scratch data directory with one mirrored file and one place map:

```
Remote-User   document    missing file   traversal attempt
zerwiz        200         404            403
craig         200         404            404
nobody        403         403            403
```

`craig` reads only the place he was granted; `nobody` reads nothing; the operator reads everything and still
gets a `404` for a file that is not there rather than the login page.

## Why it lives in the desk and not in Caddy

Caddy's portal container mounts only `/srv/gimle-login`; serving the mirror from it would need a second bind
mount and a container recreate. The desk already runs from the linked checkout, already knows who the person
is (`Remote-User` from Authelia), and already owns the membership map. Putting the door there means the
mirror inherits **the same** permission as the record — one rule, one place — instead of a second door with a
second idea about who may read what.

## Still owed

- The desk's **places** frame should list the mirrored documents per project, so a person finds them without
  knowing a URL. That is a render change, and it belongs with this one.
- The mirror itself covers one project. `bin/gimle/deploy.sh` made the code a version; the mirror is still a
  hand-written list of eight paths in Growth Agent's script.
