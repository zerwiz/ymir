"""mimir-policy.py — the law of the well: what may be written, what it is, and
what may be forgotten.

Plan 136, "the best memory an AI best friend can have". The well already had a
store and a recall; it had no *policy*. Everything below is one policy with five
faces, because each one is useless alone:

  1. THE GATE (`decide`). Before anything is stored, three questions are asked:
     does this change future behaviour, is it a commitment with consequences, or
     is it a decision with rationale? If none of the three answers yes, it is
     dropped. A memory that accepts everything is a shelf; the value of the well
     is that a keeper can trust what it holds.

  2. THE SHAPE ROUTE (`infer_store`). Every episode is one of three kinds —
     episodic (an event in time), semantic (a stable fact or preference),
     procedural (an instruction or workflow) — and the kind is stamped at write
     time so recall can filter the shelf before it searches it.

  3. THE PROVENANCE (see `provenance_tags`). An episode carries where it came
     from, what its scope is, how sure the writer was, its privacy class and its
     retention rule. The engine's own `provenance` column holds its fixed
     vocabulary (user|tool|external) and `quarantined` marks content that came
     out of untrusted context; Ymir's richer record rides in tags, because the
     engine refuses any other provenance value — measured, not guessed:
     `PROVENANCES == ('user','tool','external')`.

  4. THE CORRECTION (`correction_tags`). Episodes are corrected and retracted by
     APPENDING, chained to the original by id — never by erasing. The original
     keeps its content and gains one tag, `void:<new-id>`, which is what the ward
     (`bin/records/well-guard.sh`) already reads and what recall excludes. This is
     RULES/20-the-well-appends.md: repair adds, it does not subtract.

  5. THE FORGETTING (`grade`). Memory that never prunes becomes noise, and noise
     is the enemy of recall. Grading (nýr · eldri · forn · safn) is a continuous
     pass — decay by recency and access frequency, consolidation of overlaps,
     old documents moved to `hodd/reference/` with why they went and what
     replaced them. Nothing is deleted: an episode is annotated, a document
     moves.

Stdlib only, on purpose. The bridge, the CLI (`bin/records/mimir.sh`), the
session start and Eir all give this module the same answers, and the gate must
work when the bridge is down and the engine is unimportable.

Doors:
  mimir-policy.py gate --content "<text>" [--task "<words>"] [--shape decision]
  mimir-policy.py grade [--apply] [--json]
  mimir-policy.py memory [--json]        # the one health row (what Eir reports)
  mimir-policy.py --self-test

Exit: 0 keep / healthy · 1 the gate dropped it, or a check failed · 2 usage.
