#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-startup-network.sh - the deferred network stage of a session start.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every external-network call a session start makes used to run
# BEFORE the digest printed, on a hook that blocks session initialization: `gh
# auth status`, the secondmate liveness and convergence sweeps (per-secondmate
# remote probes, which bootstrap runs concurrently), pending remote
# handoff delivery, and the fleet-sync fetch of every project clone. None of
# those calls is individually bounded, so one unreachable host could consume the
# whole FM_SESSION_START_TIMEOUT budget and truncate the digest outright, turning
# a slow network into a startup that never printed the work queue at all.
# This script runs exactly that work OFF the blocking path: the digest is
# composed from local reads alone while these checks run concurrently in a
# detached worker, and their result is reported back inline when it finishes in
# time, or as a durable wake when it does not.
#
# WHAT IS PRESERVED. Nothing is dropped. bin/fm-bootstrap.sh remains the single
# owner of every one of these sweeps and still runs all of them, unchanged, via
# its FM_BOOTSTRAP_NETWORK=only phase. Deferral changes WHEN they run, not
# WHETHER, and three properties make the later run safe:
#   - The sweeps are idempotent DETECTORS. A run whose report is lost (killed
#     worker, truncated digest, crashed session) loses no finding: the next run
#     re-derives the same dead secondmate, the same stuck clone, the same
#     undelivered handoff. There is no once-only signal to miss.
#   - The result is durable and always surfaces. It lands in
#     state/.startup-network.report and reaches the agent either inline in the
#     digest or, when it finishes too late for the digest to inline it, as a
#     `check: startup-network` wake - but only when the late result is itself
#     actionable (state is not "done", or bootstrap emitted something other
#     than its explicit BOOTSTRAP_INFO no-action record; report_requires_wake
#     owns that transport test). A late-finishing clean run is not captain-facing progress
#     (AGENTS.md section 8) and never becomes a wake row; it is still durable
#     in the report file for `... report` to read on demand. Only a durable
#     acknowledgement written after harvest prints the finished result
#     suppresses the wake, so a claimant that exits first cannot lose the
#     result. While the worker is still running the digest states by name what
#     is not yet confirmed.
#   - Mutation authority is leased. The worker outlives the command that launched
#     it, so it takes the same acquisition lease a new session must hold before
#     replacing a dead owner, re-checks the captured owner under that lease, and
#     holds it through the bounded mutating run. A takeover stays read-only until
#     that run settles, so old and new owners can never sweep concurrently.
#
# Usage: fm-startup-network.sh start --locked <0|1> --harvest-pid <pid>
#          Launch the detached worker and return immediately. Single-flight: a
#          worker already running for the same lock owner is left alone. A new
#          owner gets a distinct generation. --locked 1 asks
#          for the mutating sweeps as well as the read-only probe; --locked 0
#          asks for the probe only. --harvest-pid names the session-start process
#          that will try to print the result inline, so the worker can tell
#          whether a wake is still needed.
#        fm-startup-network.sh run --locked <0|1>
#          Run the checks in the foreground and publish the result. This is what
#          `start` detaches with its private generation reservation; run it
#          directly to redo the stage by hand from the lock-owning harness.
#        fm-startup-network.sh harvest --pid <pid>
#          Print the digest's NETWORK CHECKS section and release the inline-print
#          claim. Called by bin/fm-session-start.sh, not by hand.
#        fm-startup-network.sh report
#          Print the current state and report without changing anything, then the
#          last run's per-step elapsed times. This is the ONLY command that prints
#          those timings: `harvest` composes the session-start digest, and adding
#          diagnostic detail there would make every startup pay for a question
#          only a slow run raises.
#        fm-startup-network.sh wait [<seconds>]
#          Block until the report is published, up to <seconds> (default 120).
#          For operators and tests only; a session start never waits.
#
# STATE, all under this home's state/ and gitignored with it:
#   .startup-network.status   key=value record - generation, lock_pid, state,
#                             pid, started, finished, rc, locked, phases, and
#                             whether the report was published. The single
#                             source of truth for what ran and how it ended.
#   .startup-network.report   the sweep output, byte for byte as
#                             bin/fm-bootstrap.sh produced it, plus a
#                             NETWORK_CHECKS: line whenever the stage itself
#                             could not complete or had to downgrade.
#   .startup-network.claim    the generation and pid of a session start that
#                             intends to print the result inline; a matching live
#                             claimant gives harvest a bounded chance to finish.
#   .startup-network.delivered
#                             a durable acknowledgement that harvest printed the
#                             current finished result; only this suppresses its
#                             wake.
#   .startup-network.timings  per-step elapsed times for the last run, in
#                             bin/fm-timing-lib.sh's tab-separated format: the
#                             stage total, one record per network phase (gh auth,
#                             secondmate liveness, secondmate convergence, handoff
#                             delivery, fleet sync), one per secondmate for the
#                             remote-touching steps (id and host), and one per
#                             project clone. Published for a timed-out or failed
#                             run too, where a partial record is the answer.
#                             Diagnostic only: nothing reads it to make a
#                             decision, and losing it never downgrades a run.
#   .startup-network.lock     serializes publication, harvest acknowledgement,
#                             and the wake decision.
#
# The whole stage is bounded by FM_STARTUP_NETWORK_TIMEOUT (default 120s), one
# aggregate deadline replacing the per-call unboundedness that used to be able to
# wedge a startup. Hitting the bound is reported as an actionable NETWORK_CHECKS:
# line, never as silence.
