#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-public-followup.sh - the deterministic consumer and delivery owner for
# public commitments made through the myfirstmate relay (X and Discord).
#
# THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES: firstmate promises a public final reply, routes the
# work out, and then the conversation compacts or the session restarts. Nothing
# in memory survives, so the promise is only kept if reconciling it is a disk
# operation. Every command here reads durable state and nothing else.
#
# OWNERSHIP BOUNDARIES (do not re-implement any of these here):
#   tasks-axi public-followup   the typed obligation and its state machine.
#   state/x-context/            the private full request context (fm-x-lib.sh).
#   bin/fm-x-reply.sh           posting to the relay, thread splitting, dry run.
#   bin/fm-public-followup-lib.sh  the activation gate and private transport.
# This script composes them; it never restates their contracts or schemas.
#
# ZERO OVERHEAD FOR HOMES THAT DO NOT USE THE RELAY: every subcommand gates
# first on the authoritative activation contract (a non-empty FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN
# in $FM_HOME/.env). Read-side and cleanup paths then use an O(1) presence check
# for registrations this home actually created. A relay-disabled home therefore
# runs one [ -f ] test before any backlog work: no tasks-axi call, no backlog scan,
# and no file created. Silent read-side commands return without output; commands
# that require an active relay report their configuration error after the same
# gate. A relay-enabled home with no live commitments stops at the second gate
# for the same cost.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-public-followup.sh active
#       Silent gate probe. Exit 0 when this home has live public-followup work
#       worth looking at, including a delivered open loop, 1 otherwise. Safe to
#       call unconditionally.
#
#   fm-public-followup.sh register <obligation-id> --relation <relation-id>
#         --work-home <main|secondmate:<id>> --work-id <task-id> --generation <n>
#         [--platform <x|discord>] [--request <request-id>]
#       Record the binding the relay path just created with `tasks-axi
#       public-followup add` + `bind-work`. This is the event-driven
#       registration: it creates this home's private public-followup directories
#       (0700) and the bounded public-safe registration record, which is what
#       later makes the presence checks O(1) and lets bound work report a typed
#       terminal result. Refuses when the relay is not active for this home.
#
#   fm-public-followup.sh brief <obligation-id>
#       Print the exact fm-public-followup-emit.sh command line the bound worker
#       must run when its work reaches the promised terminal outcome, so the
#       binding is copied into a brief instead of hand-assembled. The
#       --deliverable flags name the obligation's actual required keys.
#
#   fm-public-followup.sh consume
#       Drain every pending typed terminal event: validate its derived identity,
#       skip anything already accepted, apply `tasks-axi public-followup
#       work-event`, and quarantine what tasks-axi refuses. Prints one
#       "ready <obligation-id> <request-id> <platform>" line per obligation that
#       became delivery-ready, and one "rejected <event-id>: <reason>" line per
#       refusal. Silent when there is nothing to do. Duplicate events and restart
#       replay are no-ops.
#
#   fm-public-followup.sh pending
#       One bounded public-safe line per open public loop, for the session
#       start digest. Unresolved commitments print as "unresolved" (a reply is
#       still owed). Delivered or settled registrations print as "open-loop"
#       (the thread is still open with nothing owed). Registrations are never
#       pruned here; only `retire` removes one. Silent when nothing is open.
#
#   fm-public-followup.sh deliver <obligation-id> [--text-file <path>]
#       Post the final public reply into the ORIGINAL thread. Uses the stored
#       platform and opaque context binding, so the destination is never guessed.
#       Without --text-file the accepted terminal event's bounded public-safe
#       outcome is reused exactly, which keeps the common path deterministic.
#       The sequence is begin-delivery with the payload hash, post, then record
#       the posted receipt or a typed error. A validated receipt also clears any
#       bound legacy X link, then stamps the registration state=delivered. Delivery
#       does not close the public loop; `retire` is the only close. Prints a
#       disposition line so the loop is handed on with `rechain` or closed
#       explicitly. An already-posted obligation is an idempotent success
#       without another post; an obligation left in delivery-posting by a crash
#       is REFUSED rather than posted again.
#
#   fm-public-followup.sh record-posted <obligation-id> --attempt <n> --chunks <n>
#       Record an obligation whose post is known to have landed on exactly
#       attempt <n> with exactly <n> messages, without posting anything. This is
#       the late-receipt path: use it when a post succeeded but its receipt was
#       lost, never to paper over an unknown outcome. Stamps the registration
#       delivered; does not remove it.
#
#   fm-public-followup.sh guard-work <work-home-id> <work-id>
#       Exit 3 when this home has an unresolved public commitment bound to that
#       exact work, printing one line per blocking obligation. Exit 0 otherwise.
#       Cleanup paths call this so bound work is never treated as finished while
#       its public promise is still open. A delivered registration is not a
#       block: that work's reply already landed.
#
#   fm-public-followup.sh rechain <new-obligation-id> --from <delivered-id>
#         --work-home <main|secondmate:<id>> --work-id <task-id>
#         --expected <pr-merged|report-ready|local-main>
#         [--deliverable-key <k>]...
#       Hand a delivered public loop on to follow-on work against the same
#       thread. Decodes the retained request context, creates and binds a fresh
#       promised-final obligation, registers it, retires the source with reason
#       "handed on to <new-id>", and prints `brief` for the new obligation.
#       Refuses unless the source is state=delivered, the follow-up window is
#       still open, and the relay is active. A pre-change record without
#       request_context_b64 is un-rechainable.
#
#   fm-public-followup.sh retire <obligation-id> --reason "<why the loop is done>" [--force]
#       The only close. Drops the registration after recording --reason.
#       --force is the explicit discard-approved escape hatch for an unresolved
#       or missing obligation. --reason is required.
#
# Requires jq and a compatible tasks-axi for registration, briefs,
# reconciliation, delivery, cleanup guards, and retirement; only `active`
# inspects local state alone.
# FM_PF_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECS (default 900) sets the next-attempt time recorded with
