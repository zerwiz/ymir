# no-delete-guard.sh — Rule 11, ENFORCED. A tracked file is never deleted.
#
# WHY (2026-10-01): the Allfather — *"we can not never ever delete a file … if we need to delete it,
# we move it into ymir home to a reference folder so we can always learn from it … if we are porting
# anything … it's always getting features lost in the porting."* RULES/11 states the law; nothing
# enforced it, which made it an intention.
#
# What this does, and does NOT do:
#   · REFUSES any commit or push that deletes a tracked file.
#   · has ONE escape — YMIR_ALLOW_DELETE="<reason>" — which is **logged** with the reason, so a
#     deletion is always deliberate, always attributable, and NEVER silent.
#   · does NOT decide what should be deleted. To retire a file, MOVE it:
#       git mv <old> $YMIR_HOME/hodd/reference/<path>   (Rule 11, and the migration path)
#
#   Wired into .git/hooks/{pre-commit,pre-push} AFTER its refusal was observed to refuse
#   (scratch repo: staged deletion -> rc=1; with a reason -> rc=0 and a log line naming the
#   files). A guard not yet seen to refuse is worse than no guard, so that came first.
#
#   bin/no-delete-guard.sh --staged        # what a pre-commit hook would ask
#   bin/no-delete-guard.sh --base main    # what CI asks: what does this range delete?
#   YMIR_ALLOW_DELETE="superseded by src/…" bin/no-delete-guard.sh --staged

  To retire a file, MOVE it — it stays in the record and in the history:

      git mv <old> $YMIR_HOME/hodd/reference/<same-shape/path>

  If a deletion is genuinely correct (a secret that leaked, a file that must never exist),
  say so out loud and it is logged, never silent:

      YMIR_ALLOW_DELETE="why, in one line" git commit …
