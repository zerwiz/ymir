# WHY (plan 203 §11): a reviewer that does not hold the project's law passes work that breaks it, and does so
# politely, with a green tick. So the floor is loaded BEFORE the diff, its files are hashed, and a missing file
# is a REFUSAL — never a skip.

#   bin/forge/review-rules.sh <repo> --quote <rule> "the finding"
#                                               # a refusal in the house's own shape: rule, file, line
#
# Exit: 0 the floor is complete · 1 a source is missing (the refusal names it) · 2 usage.
