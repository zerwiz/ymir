#!/usr/bin/env bash
# review-shelf.sh — where a packet LANDS, and the waiting rule that keeps it honest.
#
# WHY (plan 205 §2.5 and §2.6): a packet with nowhere to land is a message in a bottle, and a packet
# nobody waits for is a silent delay. Three smiths and one reviewer is a queue; an unstated queue
# becomes a delay nobody measures, and the smith is left guessing whether it was read.
#
# THE SHELF IS NOT A SECOND LIST. `bin/seat/pending.sh` already reads open PRs, the wake queue, mail
# drafts and status lines; this shelf is one more SOURCE for it, and the shelf's own state is a
# directory of packets — never a parallel database of "what is waiting".
#
# THE WAITING RULE (plan 205 §2.6), stated so it can be broken loudly:
#   · a smith waits TWO ticks before it says anything;
#   · at the second tick ONE line is raised per (packet, head sha) — never a flood, the same brake
#     `bin/agents/pr-seal.sh` already uses for wakes;
#   · after THREE ticks the packet goes to the Allfather, because a reviewer that is simply absent
#     is a different problem from a reviewer that is slow.
#
# Usage:
#   review-shelf.sh drop <packet>          # put a packet on the shelf (copies; the original stays)
#   review-shelf.sh list                   # what is waiting, with its age in ticks
#   review-shelf.sh tick                   # judge the shelf: raise at most one wake per (packet, head)
#   review-shelf.sh take <id>              # the reviewer claims it: the packet leaves the shelf
#   review-shelf.sh --install-timer        # a user timer that runs `tick` every 30 minutes
#
# Exit: 0 judged · 1 a fault · 2 usage.
