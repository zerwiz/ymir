# review-watch.sh — the missing trigger: a PR that arrives is a question the owner is asked.
#
# WHY (plan 206 §10.2, the Allfather's question): *"why isn't the heart reviewing all prs that
# come in on the ymir repo and merging them."* The review SPINE already exists
# (`bin/agents/eindri-review-spawn.sh`) and the judge is real — but the spine's only trigger is
# an errand's own terminal `done`. **Nothing watched the repository**, so a PR opened by another
# hand, or by an agent that never called `acclaim`, was never seen. This is that watch.
#
# WHAT IT DOES, one pass:
#   1 · list the open PRs of the named repos (never guessed: --repo, else YMIR_REVIEW_REPOS,
#       else the one documented default);
#   2 · for each PR not already judged at THIS head, raise ONE ask through `bin/seat/lock-ask.sh`
#       — the owner's own queue — naming the PR, its head, its CI and its mergeability;
#   3 · mark the (PR, head) so a second pass in the same minute raises nothing (the flood brake);
#   4 · `--judge <n>` seats the judge for that PR through the spine, which is the owner's answer.
#
# WHAT IT NEVER DOES: merge, push, comment on GitHub, or decide. A watch that decided would be a
# gate with no judge in it.
#
# Usage:
#   review-watch.sh [--repo owner/repo ...] [--dry-run] [--json] [--all]
#   review-watch.sh --judge <n> [--repo owner/repo]      # the owner's answer: seat the judge
#   review-watch.sh --status                             # what the watch sees, and what it raised
#   review-watch.sh --install-timer [--interval 10min]    # the clock: a user timer, every 10 minutes
#   review-watch.sh --timer-status | --uninstall-timer
#
# Exit: 0 judged · 1 a fault (named) · 2 usage · 3 refused (no identity / no owner).
