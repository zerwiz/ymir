# guards.sh — every TREE ward, in one command.
#
# The pre-push hook and BOTH CI hosts call this, so the set of wards has exactly one home:
# adding a ward means adding a line here, and nowhere else. A ward judges the tree and exits
# non-zero when it finds a fault; this only aggregates.
#
# Usage:
#   guards.sh          # run every tree ward
#   guards.sh --list   # name them
#
# Exit: 0 every ward clean · 1 a ward found a fault · 2 usage.
