#          When a RUNNING local secondmate worktree is fast-forwarded to
#          firstmate's own current default-branch commit, that update is a
#          purely local fast-forward and never an origin fetch. Remote routes
#          instead converge the persistent home to their configured remote code
#          root. If either placement changes its loaded instruction surface
#          (AGENTS.md, bin/, or .agents/skills/), bootstrap immediately nudges it
#          via FM_HOME=<active-home> bin/fm-send.sh fm-<id> so meta resolves the
#          current route and the standard from-firstmate marker is applied. A
#          successful send prints one BOOTSTRAP_INFO line with the exact target
#          and message sent; a failed send leaves an idempotent retry marker
#          under state/.secondmate-nudge-pending/ and prints an actionable
#          NUDGE_SECONDMATES line.
#          Already-current or no-instruction-change homes are silently left alone.
#          The secondmate sweep also propagates declared inherited local material
#          into each validated live secondmate home.
#          SECONDMATE_SYNC lines report actionable skipped placement-specific
#          syncs or inheritance failures for live secondmate homes, plus
#          quarantine diagnostics for divergent shared captain-preference
#          copies; no-op/current and successful updates stay quiet.
#          SECONDMATE_LIVENESS lines report only actionable failures from the
#          recovery-grade state owned by bin/fm-backend.sh's
#          fm_backend_agent_state: skipped distinguishes an existing ambiguous
#          process, an unreadable target, and an unverified backend; respawn
#          failed names whether the endpoint was missing or agent-less.
#          Already-live and successfully relaunched secondmates are silent
#          unless FM_BOOTSTRAP_VERBOSE_FACTS=1 requests BOOTSTRAP_INFO facts.
#          A TANGLE line means the firstmate primary checkout (FM_ROOT) is stranded
#          on a feature branch instead of its default branch - a crewmate's work
#          landed in the primary instead of its own worktree; restore it per the line.
#          treehouse is also MISSING when its installed version lacks
#          "treehouse get --lease" support.
#          no-mistakes is also MISSING when its installed version is older than
#          1.46.0 (structured pipeline attestation floor; see CONTRIBUTING.md).
#          The AXI-family floor policy is owned beside GH_AXI_MIN and
#          LAVISH_AXI_MIN below; the per-tool owners point there. An installed
#          build below its floor reports MISSING like no-mistakes, so the operator
#          is asked to upgrade rather than silently running an older tool.
#          tasks-axi feature probes remain a separate defense-in-depth check.
#          tasks-axi and quota-axi are required bootstrap tools (same class as
#          lavish-axi). A compatible tasks-axi default backend is silent.
#          quota-axi is required for the agent-owned dispatch-profile array
#          procedure in AGENTS.md section 4 and
#          .agents/skills/quota-array-dispatch/SKILL.md.
#          On a primary home, the locked mutable path materializes the visible
#          default config/startup-memory-budget=7500 when absent. It never
#          guesses at malformed or unsafe existing files, and secondmate homes
#          await the primary-authoritative inherited value instead of creating
#          their own.
#          X mode is OPTIONAL and inert unless FM_HOME/.env has a non-empty
#          FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN. When opted in, bootstrap requires curl+jq, writes
#          the relay poll shim and 30s cadence config, and prints an FMX line.
#          Fleet sync fetches, fast-forwards safe default-branch states, reports
#          recovered and STUCK clone drift, and prunes gone local branches; it is
#          bounded by FM_FLEET_SYNC_BOOTSTRAP_TIMEOUT when it is a non-empty
#          numeric override, while non-numeric values fall back to 20s.
#          When the override is unset or blank, the timeout is
#          max(20, 5 + 3 * origin-backed project clone count). A timed-out
#          refresh relays any completed fm-fleet-sync.sh output before the
#          aggregate timeout skip line with timeout and elapsed seconds.
#          Set FM_FLEET_PRUNE=0 to skip branch pruning during that refresh.
#          BACKLOG_RECONCILE lines report what backlog_record_reconcile could not
#          settle in THIS home. Every ordinary dispatch and completion now moves
#          the backlog row inside the script that moves the task's record
#          (bin/fm-backlog-transition-lib.sh), so this sweep exists for the
#          crash window inside those scripts and for drift a home was already
#          carrying: it finishes the authoritative close an interrupted cleanup
#          recorded, and marks In flight any item this home already owns a worker
#          for. The worker-record sweep never starts a captain-held or closed
#          item, and reconciliation never reads or writes another home; the fleet
#          snapshot's classifier and
#          bin/fm-secondmate-reconcile.sh's nudge stay as backstops. Replayed
#          closes and restored In-flight rows print BOOTSTRAP_INFO facts.
#          Set FM_BOOTSTRAP_DETECT_ONLY=1 to skip the six MUTATING sweeps
#          (backlog_record_reconcile, secondmate_sync,
#          secondmate_liveness_sweep, secondmate_handoff_resume, x_mode_setup,
#          fleet_sync) while still
#          printing every read-only detect line
#          above; the TANGLE line switches to advisory-only wording with no
#          checkout command. Used by
#          fm-session-start.sh's read-only path when another live session holds
#          the fleet lock, so a second concurrent session never race-mutates
#          secondmate homes, pending handoff outboxes,
#          X-mode artifacts, project clones, or repair instructions.
#          Unset/0 (the default) runs all six sweeps - this flag is purely
#          additive.
#          Set FM_BOOTSTRAP_NETWORK to split this run by whether a step talks to
#          the network, so a session start can print its digest from local reads
#          alone and run the network half off the digest's blocking path:
#            all  (default, and any unrecognized value) - every local and network
#                 step. Unrecognized values fall back here on purpose: a typo
#                 must never silently skip a safety sweep.
#            skip - every LOCAL step, and none of the network ones. Skips
#                 `gh auth status`, secondmate_liveness_sweep, secondmate_sync,
#                 secondmate_handoff_resume, and fleet_sync.
#            only - ONLY those network steps and nothing else. No tool detection,
#                 no version floors, no tangle check, no backlog
#                 reconciliation, no x_mode_setup: those already ran on the
#                 local pass.
#          FM_BOOTSTRAP_DETECT_ONLY composes with it unchanged, so `only` plus
#          detect-only is the read-only `gh auth status` probe on its own.
#          bin/fm-startup-network.sh owns the deferral: it runs the `only` phase
#          in a detached bounded worker and publishes the result. This file stays
#          the single owner of every sweep, and the split changes only WHEN each
#          runs, never WHETHER. During the network phase, project clone refresh
#          overlaps the independent secondmate work. Per-secondmate remote
#          liveness workers run concurrently and finish before per-secondmate
#          remote convergence workers run concurrently, because convergence
#          consumes respawned ids. Worker output is captured separately and
#          replayed in spawn order; failure to create that private capture
#          directory selects the sequential fallback.
#          A relaunch that the liveness sweep performs during an `only` run is
#          always reported, because a digest composed before that run already
#          printed the superseded endpoint record.
#          Set FM_BOOTSTRAP_LOCKED=1 alongside it when the sweeps are skipped
#          because THIS session already ran them while holding the fleet lock,
#          rather than because it has no lock at all. The two cases differ in
#          exactly one place: repair ownership. A locked session is told to
#          restore a tangled primary checkout itself, while an unlocked one is
#          told to leave that work to the lock holder. Unset/0 (the default)
#          keeps detect-only meaning unlocked, exactly as before.
#        fm-bootstrap.sh install <tool>...
#          Install the named tools (only ones the captain approved).

# Drops two idempotent, gitignored artifacts:
#   state/x-watch.check.sh - byte-static identity shim; the watcher validates
#                            its bytes and invokes bin/fm-x-poll.sh directly
#   config/x-mode.env      - exports FM_CHECK_INTERVAL=30, sourced by the watcher
#                            arm so only an X instance polls at the 30s cadence
# On opt-out (no token, or empty) it removes any such artifacts so the instance
# reverts to the default 300s no-poll behavior. Absent a token AND with no leftover
# artifacts it is a complete no-op (nothing written, nothing printed), so a non-X
# user sees zero change. Prints one confirmation line on opt-in, and one on opt-out
# only when it actually removed artifacts. It never touches the watcher itself;
# applying a cadence transition to a running watcher is the caller's job via
