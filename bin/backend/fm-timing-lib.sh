# fm-timing-lib.sh - the single owner of the deferred network stage's elapsed-time
# instrumentation.
#
# Sourced, never executed.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The deferred stage (bin/fm-startup-network.sh) publishes one
# aggregate started/finished pair, so a run that took a minute could not be
# attributed to a phase, a host, or a clone without re-running it by hand under
# manual tracing. These helpers record per-step elapsed times as the run happens,
# so the next slow run is answerable from the durable record alone.
#
# OFF BY DEFAULT, AND INERT. Every helper is a no-op unless FM_TIMING_LOG names a
# file. Nothing here talks to the network, waits, locks, or changes control flow:
# a failed append is discarded rather than propagated, because losing a diagnostic
# line must never change what a sweep does or how it exits.
#
# ENVIRONMENT, both exported by the stage that owns a run:
#   FM_TIMING_LOG       append-only record file. Unset or empty disables recording.
#                       Exported across process boundaries on purpose: the phases
#                       being measured run in bin/fm-bootstrap.sh and
#                       bin/fm-fleet-sync.sh, which are children of the stage.
#   FM_TIMING_EPOCH_MS  the run's start instant, so every record carries an offset
#                       from ONE origin even though the records are written by
#                       several processes. Defaults to the first recording
#                       process's own start, which keeps a hand-run child readable.
#
# RECORD FORMAT, one tab-separated line per measured step:
#   v1 <TAB> scope <TAB> name <TAB> start-offset-ms <TAB> elapsed-ms <TAB> detail
# Appends are single short lines opened O_APPEND, so concurrent writers interleave
# whole lines rather than corrupting each other.
#
# NO SECRETS, BY CONSTRUCTION. `detail` names an identity - a secondmate id, a
# host, a clone directory name - and identities never contain whitespace, while
# the things that must never reach this file (a command line, an environment
# dump, a captured error) always do. So a detail carrying ANY whitespace is not a
# truncated identity, it is free text that arrived from somewhere it should not
# have, and it is dropped entirely rather than cleaned up: cleaning would leave
# the token in `KEY=secret` behind, because a credential is made of exactly the
# characters an identity is made of. What remains is then narrowed to
# [A-Za-z0-9._@:/+-] and truncated, which is what stops a detail from forging
# extra tab-separated records. Enforcing this here rather than at each call site
# is what makes "this file cannot carry a credential or an argv" checkable in one
# place.
