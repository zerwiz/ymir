# Steer a task by durable record: write the message into the task's steering
# inbox and ring a constant doorbell line into its terminal, best-effort.
# Usage: fm-send.sh <target> [--resolve-key <key>]... [--fire-and-forget <delivery-id>] <text...>
#   <target> may be an exact task id, a legacy fm-<id> task label resolved
#   through this home's state/<id>.meta, or an explicit well-formed backend
#   target. fm-send refuses unresolved guesses rather than falling back to a
#   tmux window search, because a "successful" send to the wrong endpoint is
#   worse than a loud failure.
# Special keys instead of text: fm-send.sh <target> --key Enter
# Key support is backend-specific: tmux/herdr support Escape, Enter, and C-c;
# Orca currently supports Enter and C-c only, and rejects Escape.
#
# Two data planes:
#
# INBOX - the default for text to a task recorded in this home, local and
# remote alike. The message is appended as a durable sequenced record under
# the task's steering inbox (newlines are legal) - state/<id>.inbox/ for a
# local task, or the remote home's host-local inbox reached through fm-on.sh
# for a remote secondmate - and the terminal receives only one short constant
# self-describing doorbell line plus Enter, best-effort. The durable record IS
# the delivery, so the record's fate alone governs the exit: 0 = the steer is
# durably sent (recorded); nonzero = nothing was confirmed delivered and a
# resend is appropriate (unresolvable target, an endpoint that cannot be
# locked and revalidated or that retired or changed, an unwritable record, a
# failed or lost remote transport) or a decision-close append failed after
# delivery (the error then carries the exact manual close). The remote enqueue
# is idempotent: the remote leg deduplicates an exact re-run of the same
# request onto the existing record (bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh), so after a lost
# transport (ssh exit 255, completion unknown) fm-send retries the same leg
# once itself. For an ordinary reply-bearing request, a later re-run is
# idempotent only through the printed FM_PENDING_REPLY_EXISTING_CORR=<corr>
# command: it preserves the same correlation, body, and record, while a plain
# re-run mints a new correlation and delivers a separate record. An explicit
# fire-and-forget request instead retries with its same caller-supplied delivery
# id. A still-unconfirmed reply-bearing request keeps its reply expectation
# preserved for the record that may have landed.
# Pending-reply bookkeeping trouble after a durable enqueue NEVER exits
# nonzero: with the recovery marker stored the watcher reconciles it silently,
# and with both the commit and the marker lost the send prints a distinct
# "reply-tracking-degraded (steer delivered, do not resend)" warning instead,
# because a resend-inviting status there would duplicate a delivered
# instruction. There is no delivered-unconfirmed
# outcome on this plane: "did the doorbell land" is no longer the question -
# "was the message acted on" is, and that is answered asynchronously for an
# ordinary record by the worker's acknowledgement move into handled/, with the
# watcher re-ringing an unacknowledged message and escalating a stuck one. An
# explicit fire-and-forget record is excluded from that ladder.
# bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh owns the record format, the doorbell line, and the
# re-ring ladder. The composer pre-check before the ring is ADVISORY only: when
# the composer visibly holds pending text the ring is skipped with a notice and
# the watcher re-rings an ordinary record later; no composer verdict is
# delivery proof on this plane, and a failed ring never fails the send.
#
# TYPED - the LOCAL text that must reach the terminal itself: a harness-native
# invocation (a leading "/", or a leading "$" to a codex target) must reach
# the harness's own parser, and an explicit backend target names an endpoint,
# not a task, so it stays typed even when local metadata happens to match it
# (the same boundary that keeps it unmarked and outside --resolve-key). These
# type the literal
# text through the target backend's verified submit core: typed ONCE, then
# Enter retried (never retyped) until the backend confirms a submit or reports
# an inconclusive send. Typed-plane exit contract: 0 = submit confirmed;
# 3 = the text was typed into the live endpoint and
# Enter was sent, but the submit read-back stayed unconfirmed (verify the pane
# before any resend, and never re-type blindly; a marked request's
# pending-reply expectation stays armed because this outcome is not a proven
# failure); any other nonzero = the send failed and nothing may be assumed
# delivered. Submission dispatches through the target's recorded backend; the
# tmux adapter shares its composer/submit core with the away-mode daemon via
# bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh. Tune with FM_SEND_RETRIES (default 3) / FM_SEND_SLEEP
# (0.4). Slash commands, and codex `$...` skill invocations resolved through
# harness meta, get a longer pre-Enter settle so completion popups do not
# swallow Enter. A remote secondmate target has no typed text plane at all:
# every remote text steer rides the inbox (a marked secondmate request already
# reaches the harness as marker-prefixed chat rather than a parser command, so
# routing a remote "/..." or "$..." through the record changes nothing the
# parser would have seen); only --key still crosses to the remote pane as a
# keystroke.
#
# Stage-1 compatibility boundary: classification uses the original pre-marker
# text, but secondmate marking still precedes every typed submission. Therefore
# a marked parser-native secondmate invocation intentionally reaches the harness
# as marker-prefixed chat rather than executing as a parser command. This is a
# pre-existing interaction retained for byte compatibility in this local-inbox
# stage; do not move the marker behind the invocation or omit it here. Follow-up
# fm-send-secondmate-harness-invocation-r1 owns that behavior.
#
# From-firstmate marker: when the resolved target is a task selector whose meta
# records kind=secondmate, the message uses the live-charter-compatible
# from-firstmate carrier owned by bin/fm-operational-input.sh so the secondmate
# routes its reply via its status file or a status-pointed doc instead of
# stranding it in chat the main firstmate never reads. On the inbox plane the
# marker travels verbatim inside the recorded body. A crewmate/scout target,
# an explicit backend-target escape-hatch target, and the --key path are never
# marked - their behavior is unchanged.
#
# Parent-owned pending-reply expectation: every newly marked secondmate request
# except an explicit --fire-and-forget delivery receives a privacy-safe
# correlation id and a durable parent record under state/pending-replies/ before
# delivery (bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh). Delivery
# success and reply success are separate facts: delivery never resolves the
# expectation. On the inbox plane the durable enqueue IS delivery to the task's
# record, so the expectation is marked delivered at enqueue time; when that
# bookkeeping commit fails after its durable recovery marker is stored, the
# send remains successful and watcher reconciliation owns the repair, and when
# the commit and marker are BOTH lost the send still remains successful with a
# reply-tracking-degraded warning naming the expectation an operator must
# inspect (it can no longer reconcile or escalate on its own). Only a
# failed enqueue discards the expectation. On the typed plane an unconfirmed submit (exit 3) keeps
# it armed rather than dropping it, and only a proven send failure discards it.
# Set FM_PENDING_REPLY_EXISTING_CORR=<id> when re-sending a recovery request
# for an already-open expectation so a second record is not created. Direct
# unmarked captain input never creates one. A marked secondmate instruction
# sent with --fire-and-forget <16-hex-delivery-id> uses the same inbox transport
# without creating a reply expectation; its delivery id makes uncertain retries
# idempotent while allowing a later identical instruction to be distinct.
#
# Remote secondmate delivery: the send crosses fm-on.sh to a host-local leg
# (bin/fm-remote-secondmate-control.sh cmd_send) that writes the message as a
# durable record into the remote home's steering inbox and rings the remote
# doorbell, best-effort. The remote record is the delivery, exactly as it is
# locally: leg exit 0 means durably recorded (fm-send then exits 0, marks the
# pending-reply expectation delivered, and closes any --resolve-key
# decisions), and any real remote failure fails loudly with the remote leg's
# own stderr attached. Transport loss (ssh exit 255) means completion unknown,
# so fm-send retries the identical leg once - safe because the remote write
# deduplicates the same request onto the same record - and a still-lost
# transport exits nonzero while preserving a reply-bearing marked request's
# expectation, since the record may have landed. Its error prints the exact
# FM_PENDING_REPLY_EXISTING_CORR=<id> resend command that preserves the body
# and makes a later remote enqueue deduplicate onto that same record. An
# unconfirmed fire-and-forget request exits 3 and names the same delivery id to
# retry. Every remote transport attempt is bounded by FM_SEND_REMOTE_BUDGET
# seconds (default 30, and any override must be a positive integer): a bound
# hit is completion-unknown and exits through this same unconfirmed contract
# instead of waiting out a busy remote queue.
# The remote host runs no re-ring ladder of its own: a swallowed ordinary
# doorbell surfaces through the parent's pending-reply recovery and escalation,
# whose recovery request re-rings the remote doorbell when it is enqueued;
# fire-and-forget delivery deliberately arms neither mechanism. Internal
# semantic callers may set FM_SEND_EXPECTED_SPAWN_GEN or
# FM_SEND_EXPECTED_REMOTE_HOST to require that sampled identity to still match
# during the final locked remote-route validation; unset or empty guards do not
# change ordinary sends.
#
# Decision closure (answerer-closes): pass --resolve-key <key> (repeatable,
# before the message) when this send answers an open keyed needs-decision: or
# blocked: record in the target task's state/<id>.status. fm-send itself
# appends the closing "resolved [key=<key>]: answered: <capped excerpt>" line
# to that status file, so the captain-facing OPEN DECISIONS record closes at
# answer time and never depends on the busy worker writing a matching resolved
# line. On the inbox plane the close happens at ENQUEUE time, because enqueue
# is durable delivery to the task's record; the worker reading the answer late
# is covered by the acknowledgement re-ring ladder. On the typed plane it
# still waits for the confirmed submit. The close is a LOCAL append for every
# target kind - crewmate, scout, local secondmate, and remote secondmate alike
# - because the open-decision ledger fm-wake-drain folds lives in this home's
# own state dir (a remote mate's escalations reach it through the
# parent-replies ingest); only the answer message crosses the backend or
# remote transport.
#
# Chat is also a channel that carries keyed captain answers, so the same flag
# feeds bin/fm-captain-hold.sh's one keyed-answer intake for any key that names
# a captain-held task in this home - the key as a task id itself, or through
# the legacy `<task>-decision-<key>` identity for pre-collapse rows. fm-send
# closes nothing itself; it hands the intake `<task-id>\t<answer>\t<label>`
# exactly as every other channel does, and the intake owns what that means.
# This is what lets an answer reach a decision that has already been
# transferred from the live status log to its durable captain-held task, which
# the status ledger alone can no longer close.
#
# Each named key must therefore currently be open in ONE of the two ledgers: open
# in this home's status log per status_open_decisions (bin/fm-classify-lib.sh), or
# a still-open captain-held task resolved as above. A key in neither is refused
# before sending, so a mistyped key cannot deliver an answer while silently
# orphaning the decision. A failed or unconfirmed send never closes a key; a
# delivered answer whose closing append fails exits nonzero with the exact
# manual close command, leaving the decision open to re-surface (the safe
# direction). A send without the flag never closes anything: a routine steer,
# working:, or done: event still cannot clear a captain decision. The flag is
# refused with --key, with an explicit backend target (no task ledger in this
# home), and with an empty message.
#
# After a successful TYPED-plane submit fm-send pauses FM_SEND_SETTLE seconds
# (default 1, 0 disables) before returning: submit confirmation only proves the
# text was accepted, but the harness needs a beat to spin up the turn before its
# busy footer appears, so an immediate peek would otherwise see the stale idle
# pane. The pause is typed-plane-only; the inbox plane, the shared submit core
# (used by the away-mode daemon, which only needs "submitted"), and the --key
# path do not pay it.
