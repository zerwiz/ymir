# Enter away mode and run the sub-supervisor daemon in a harness-tracked
# foreground process when one is not already alive.
#
# Usage: fm-afk-start.sh
#   Sets state/.afk unless FM_AFK_STATE_PREPARED=1, checks
#   state/.supervise-daemon.lock, and:
#     - prints "afk: daemon already running pid=<pid>" then exits 0 when that
#       lock is held by a live daemon (a REFRESH: no stale-artifact clear);
#     - otherwise clears any prior away session's stale escalation artifacts
#       (fm_afk_clear_stale_artifacts) for a direct, non-prepared start, then
#       execs bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh in the foreground. A prepared start was
#       already cleared transactionally by bin/fm-afk-launch.sh.
#
# This file is sourceable: its BASH_SOURCE guard keeps main from running, while
# exposing the daemon-lock helpers and fm_afk_clear_stale_artifacts. Sourcing it
# enables nounset and errexit; callers that need different shell options must
# restore them explicitly.
#
# This is the COMMON daemon entry for every backend. HOW it becomes a tracked
# background process differs by harness/backend and is owned elsewhere:
#   - Harnesses with a native in-pane tracked-background tool (e.g. claude, grok)
#     run this directly via that tool, so the daemon inherits the captain pane's
#     env and auto-discovers it.
#   - Harnesses with NO native background mechanism (e.g. pi) run this THROUGH
#     bin/fm-afk-launch.sh, which creates a non-visible tracked terminal per
#     backend (herdr tab/workspace, tmux detached session) and passes the
#     captain pane in as FM_SUPERVISOR_TARGET so injection targets it, not the
#     daemon's own new pane.
# Do not wrap this in `nohup ... &`: Codex/herdr can reap fire-and-forget shell
# children after the tool call returns, while a tracked background terminal stays
# attached and has a real lifecycle.

# fm_afk_clear_stale_artifacts: on a FRESH away-session entry (the daemon is not
# already running), drop the previous away session's leftover escalation-delivery
# artifacts so they cannot surface as stale escalations under the new session.
# These are session-scoped by timing: a fresh entry owns a new supervision
# session and the new daemon has not produced anything yet, so anything present
# here belongs to a PRIOR session. This never drops a genuinely-pending
# escalation - the delivery buffer is a transient cache, and any condition still
# true (a crew still blocked, a check still firing) is re-derived and re-escalated
# fresh by the daemon's heartbeat catch-all scan and the durable
# state/.wake-queue replay (see docs/herdr-backend.md "Away-mode stale-artifact
# lifecycle" and bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh's escalate_add/inject_wedge_alarm).
