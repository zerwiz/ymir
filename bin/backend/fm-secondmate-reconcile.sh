#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-secondmate-reconcile.sh - ask a secondmate to reconcile its own books, at
# most once per home per cooldown window.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-secondmate-reconcile.sh notify [--snapshot <file>|-]
#   fm-secondmate-reconcile.sh nudged <mate-id>
#
# This is a BACKSTOP, not the primary mechanism. Dispatch and completion pair
# the backlog row with the task's record inside the one script that moves the
# record, and each home reconciles its own books at session start
# (bin/fm-backlog-transition-lib.sh), so what reaches here is what neither could
# see: a home that has not restarted since it drifted, or one still running
# older code.
#
# A backlog-vs-metadata inventory mismatch inside a secondmate home
# (orphan_in_flight, unowned_current, terminal_in_flight) no longer makes that
# home unreadable: bin/fm-fleet-snapshot.sh keeps its decisions, queued, landed,
# and live work and carries the mismatch for renderers. The books are still
# wrong, and only the home that owns them may fix them, so the parent sends one
# reconcile instruction and stops there.
#
# What this script owns:
#   - reading the mismatch from an already-produced fleet snapshot, so nothing
#     here re-parses another home's state or runs a second child summary;
#   - the cooldown. One durable per-home timestamp records the last nudge, and a
#     home is nudged only when that timestamp is older than the cooldown window
#     (FM_RECONCILE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS, four hours). A recap or digest loop
#     therefore cannot nag, while a mismatch still sitting there hours later
#     earns one gentle re-nudge. Deliberately coarse: a timestamp cannot go
#     stale, cannot mis-order against a concurrent snapshot, and cannot
#     mis-classify a repair as a new problem, which an identity-precise record
#     has to get right in every direction to avoid silently swallowing a nudge;
#   - sending through bin/fm-send.sh's fire-and-forget plane, which records the
#     instruction durably for local and remote mates alike while staying out of
#     the steering inbox's re-ring and escalation ladder: the parent expects no
#     reply, so nothing should chase one.
#
# What this script must never do:
#   - edit the mate's backlog, metadata, or queue from the parent. The mate owns
#     its own cleanup; the parent only asks.
#   - block a snapshot or digest. The enqueue is a fast local durable write, and
#     a send failure is reported, never fatal to the caller's own work.
#
# Lock acquisition is non-blocking. A busy reconcile, lifecycle-control, or
# metadata lock skips that home without starting its cooldown, so a later recap
# can retry. The sampled endpoint identity is revalidated before delivery, by
# fm-send under its final route lock, and before the cooldown commit so a retired
# endpoint is never nudged or allowed to silence its replacement.
#
# A persistent REMOTE secondmate's parent-side metadata intentionally has no
# spawn_gen (docs/remote-secondmates.md). Such a row is legitimate and markerless
# by construction, not corrupt, so it uses its sampled remote_host as the separate
# identity guard. The current metadata must still have no spawn_gen and must still
# name that host. A row with neither identity fails loudly.
#
# Exit status: 0 when no delivery or cooldown-recording failure is known,
# including when a home was skipped for lock contention or a stale endpoint;
# 1 when at least one due send failed or its cooldown could not be recorded.
# A known-undelivered send records nothing, so the next snapshot retries it; an
# unconfirmed send records the nudge, because a duplicate ask is worse than one
# the mate may already have.
#
# Output, one line per selected home in mismatch:
#   sent: <mate-id> <kind>          one reconcile instruction was recorded
#   cooldown: <mate-id> <seconds>   nudged this recently; nothing sent
#   skipped: <mate-id> lock         a required lock was busy; cooldown unchanged
#   stale: <mate-id> <kind>         the sampled endpoint retired or changed
#   failed: <mate-id> <kind>        the steer could not be recorded
#   sent-unrecorded: <mate-id> <kind>  sent, but cooldown commit failed
