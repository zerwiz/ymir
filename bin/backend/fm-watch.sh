# Firstmate watcher.
# Classifies supervision wakes in bash. In normal mode it absorbs benign wakes
# and keeps blocking; it queues and exits only for actionable wakes.
# The no-verb signal and stale path is absorb-only-on-positive-evidence: a wake
# is absorbed only when the crew shows it is still working through an actively
# running no-mistakes step or a backend busy signal. A home that opts in with
# config/turnend-churn-absorb lets a bare turn-end also use bounded pane churn
# since the previous poll. Every other no-verb wake surfaces, so a crew
# that finishes (or stops and waits) is never silently swallowed. A declared wait,
# either a paused: external wait or a verified captain-held transfer, is the
# separate idle absorb case and re-surfaces only on its long bounded cadence,
# although its initial no-verb status signal still surfaces in normal mode.
# While state/.afk exists, the daemon owns triage and this watcher queues and exits
# on every wake. Printed reason lines:
#   signal: <file>...      status/turn-end signals, surfaced when a listed status
#                          span has a captain-relevant event OR a no-verb signal lacks
#                          positive execution evidence, unless afk is active
#   stale: <window>        a provably-working stale is ALWAYS absorbed (with a wedge
#                          timer) regardless of what the status log says - an active
#                          run-step or busy pane outranks even a captain-relevant log
#                          line, since the crew's own log gets no new entry once
#                          firstmate hands it to a no-mistakes validation. A declared
#                          external-wait pause or verified captain-held transfer is
#                          absorbed instead with its own long re-surface cadence,
#                          never as a wedge, and that recheck reason names which
#                          human the wait is on. Only when neither absorb class
#                          applies does the log's last line decide:
#                          terminal (captain-relevant) or non-terminal (no verb),
#                          both surfaced at once. A provably-working stale past the
#                          wedge threshold also surfaces, with an "escalation N"
#                          count in the reason; at FM_WEDGE_DEMAND_INSPECT_COUNT
#                          consecutive escalations on the SAME pane, the reason
#                          also carries a "demand-deep-inspection" marker so the
#                          wake payload itself, not just repetition, forces a
#                          closer look instead of another routine supervision
#                          resume. Unless afk is active. A pane whose own task
#                          worktree was written during the quiet window is
#                          deferred rather than escalated (wedge_defer_writing),
#                          because files appearing there are liveness the pane and
#                          the run step cannot show; that deferral still
#                          re-surfaces once per PAUSE_RESURFACE_SECS, and a pane
#                          that writes nothing keeps the unchanged schedule.
#                          A genuinely busy pane
#                          (window_is_busy true) is exempt from the above, but
#                          only up to BUSY_TURN_MAX_SECS with no completed turn
#                          (state/<id>.turn-ended, or the spawn record before any
#                          turn completes). Past that bound, a declared external
#                          wait or verified captain-held transfer uses the long
#                          pause recheck cadence (under afk it is instead handed
#                          to the daemon as this plain reason, once per
#                          declaration; busy_turn_bound_check owns that handoff);
#                          every other pane goes through the same wedge timer and
#                          surfaces with the identical "stale: ..." reason,
#                          escalation count, and demand-deep-inspection marker,
#                          for human inspection only - never an automatic

# is the single owner of per-harness sources, source attribution, and the one
# remaining rendered-text fallback (Grok only).
# Always-on wake triage: most wakes during a long crew validation are benign (a
# working: note or turn-end while a pipeline runs, a no-change heartbeat). Rather
# than wake firstmate's LLM for each, this watcher classifies every wake in bash
# and ABSORBS the benign majority - it advances the suppression marker, logs to a
# debug log, and keeps blocking WITHOUT enqueuing or exiting. The no-verb signal
# / stale path is absorb-only-on-positive-evidence. The shared proof is an actively
# running no-mistakes step or a busy pane via crew_is_provably_working over
# fm-crew-state.sh; where config/turnend-churn-absorb opts in, a bare turn-end alone
# may also use bounded pane churn since the previous poll.
# Every other crew that stopped its turn is SURFACED, so a finish reported
# only through interactive pane menus (no done: status) is never swallowed. An
# ACTIONABLE wake (a captain-relevant signal, a no-verb signal without either
# eligible proof, any check, a stale pane whose crew is not provably working, a
# provably-working stale past the threshold, or anything unknown) is written to
# the durable queue and exits. That wakes the LLM through the background-task
# completion. The same classifier
# (fm-classify-lib.sh) backs the away-mode daemon; while state/.afk exists the

#
# It exists because the first two are unreachable for a harness whose semantic
# busy state has no verified source: bin/fm-crew-state.sh can only answer unknown
# for such an adapter, crew_is_provably_working is therefore never satisfiable,
# and every worker turn boundary surfaced a wake with nothing to act on - the cost
# scaling with the number of workers in flight. Pane churn needs no harness
# cooperation, so it restores the absorb branch for those adapters without
# fabricating a busy verdict any adapter has not earned.
#
# The evidence is the one the pane-staleness backbone below already trusts for
# liveness: this compares a fresh capture against the .hash- marker that backbone
# recorded on the previous poll, which is why the derivation lives here with the
# marker format rather than in the shared classifier. Absorbing here DEFERS a wake
# rather than swallowing it, and the deferral is BOUNDED: a task's turn-ends may
# ride churn evidence for at most FM_TURNEND_CHURN_ABSORB_SECS, tracked per window
# in .churn-since-, after which the wake surfaces and the window restarts. The
# bound is what keeps churn from muting supervision outright. A pane that renders
# continuously - a clock, a spinner, a shell heartbeat, a harness that leaves a
# background renderer alive after its agent yields - never presents the two
# identical consecutive hashes the staleness backbone needs either, so without the
# bound a worker that had genuinely stopped behind such a renderer would be
# deferred here forever with no fallback path left to surface it. Churn and
# staleness read the same pane, so neither can be the other's only backstop.
# Within the bound, an ordinary crew that stops renders nothing more, its pane
# hash stops moving, and the staleness backbone surfaces it within a couple of
# polls; any captain-relevant status verb still surfaces immediately through
# signal_files_actionable. That is why this widens the proof instead of
# bounding the wake rate, which would have suppressed genuinely stopped workers.
#
# Every negative outcome returns 1, so absence of evidence surfaces exactly as
# before: any batch that references a secondmate, an unresolvable task, a task
# with no uniquely attributable recorded endpoint, no previous hash to compare
# against (nothing has been polled yet), a capture that fails or comes back empty,
# an exhausted deferral bound, and of course an unchanged pane. Any .status file
# also returns 1: an authored append is content the
# supervisor may need to read, so only the mechanical turn-end marker gets the
# fallback.
#
# NOT a pure read: one bounded pane capture per referenced task that lacks
# authoritative proof. Once EVERY task passes, each churn-proven pane's prior
# .stale- classification and wedge-escalation count are cleared because churn
# begins a new quiet interval; retaining either would make the new interval
# inherit the prior one. Reached only for a non-afk, no-captain-verb signal, so
# it never runs on the ordinary per-wake path.
