# fm-tool-update-check.sh - report watched tooling that has an update available,
# and tooling whose update is installed but not in effect.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-tool-update-check.sh [check]
#   fm-tool-update-check.sh arm
#   fm-tool-update-check.sh disarm
#   fm-tool-update-check.sh --help
#
# `check` prints one line when something needs attention and prints nothing at
# all otherwise, so it composes with the existing watcher state-check contract
# instead of needing a schedule of its own. `arm` writes
# state/tool-updates.check.sh and binds its bytes with fm-check-register.sh, so
# the watcher dispatches it on its normal FM_CHECK_INTERVAL cadence and turns
# its one line into a `check:` wake. `disarm` removes the shim, its trust
# binding, and the report record.
#
# Two conditions are reported, and they are deliberately distinct:
#
#   "<tool> update available"      a newer version exists at the update source.
#   "<tool> update not in effect"  a newer copy is installed on this host, but
#                                  PATH still resolves an older one.
#
# The second condition is the reason this script exists. A tool that
# self-installs into ~/.local/bin while a version manager keeps its own older
# copy earlier on PATH looks fully up to date to anything that asks only "is a
# newer version published". So PATH skew is measured, never inferred: every
# executable copy on PATH is asked for its own version, and those answers are
# compared. A directory name is never read as a version, because a version
# manager's "latest" directory can hold an older build. A copy that will not
# report a version is reported as a check failure rather than assumed current.
#
# What this script never does: it reports, and it repairs nothing. It does not
# install, update, uninstall, reorder PATH, or touch any version manager's
# configuration, and it never fetches into a watched git repository. Every git
# probe is read-only (rev-parse, symbolic-ref, ls-remote, cat-file, merge-base,
# rev-list), so a watched project is never mutated.
#
# The watched tools live in config/watched-tools.json, which is local and
# gitignored, and is never propagated to another home. Adding a tool is a config
# edit, never a code change. docs/configuration.md owns that schema.
#
# Probing costs real time, so `check` runs its probes at most once per
# FM_TOOL_UPDATE_INTERVAL (default 900, 0 disables the gate, otherwise 60..86400)
# and stays silent in between. Each probe is bounded by
# FM_TOOL_UPDATE_PROBE_SECS (default 5, valid 1..30) and a whole sweep by
# FM_TOOL_UPDATE_BUDGET_SECS (default 20, valid 1..120).
#
# The sweep has to finish inside the watcher's own per check bound, because a run
# the watcher kills prints nothing and writes no record, so it would repeat that
# silence on every poll. That coupling is enforced rather than assumed: a budget
# larger than FM_CHECK_TIMEOUT (default 30, read from this check's own
# environment because the watcher runs it as a direct child) allows is cut down
# to what fits, and the cut is reported in the report line so the operator sees
# it. A budget that cannot be read as a whole number from 1 to 120 is still
# refused outright.
#
# The report record state/.tool-updates is written only when a sweep runs to its
# end, and it carries the whole finding set the last report was made from,
# uncut, so the same pending update is reported once rather than on every poll
# while a new finding that lands past the one-line cut is still news. A sweep
# killed part way through leaves no record and is retried, instead of
# suppressing its finding.
