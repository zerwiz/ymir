# The kit goes into Node, Elixir and shell repositories, so the hooks must not assume one of them. This door
# probes for the repository's own check and runs that; it never invents a command and never guesses a tool.
# A repository with no check of its own is a SKIP that says so — a clean skip is a pass, a silent green is a
# lie (RULES/25).
#
# First match wins:
#   1. scripts/doctor.sh · scripts/test.sh   a repository that names its own doors
#   2. package.json                         npm run check / typecheck, npm run test
#   3. mix.exs                              mix compile --warnings-as-errors, mix test
#   4. nothing                              skip, printed plainly
#
# Exit: 0 passed or skipped · non-zero a check failed · 2 usage.
