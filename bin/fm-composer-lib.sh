#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bin/fm-composer-lib.sh - the ONE fleet-wide owner of composer classification:
# every shape a verified harness draws, every glyph, every container proof, and
# the empty|pending|pending-unproven|unknown verdict, shared by every
# session-provider adapter (tmux via bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh, and
# bin/backends/{herdr,orca,cmux,zellij}.sh) and by fm-spawn.sh's kimi
# launch-readiness check.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (tasks fm-composer-shellglyph-safety and
# fm-composer-thin-adapter-refactor-r1): the adapters each carried their own
# copy of composer shape knowledge, and every copy drifted. The audited result
# (data/fm-composer-consolidation-audit-s1) was a 5-adapter x 6-harness matrix
# in which no adapter was right about more than five harnesses, no two adapters
# were wrong in the same places, and one harness was unreadable everywhere.
# The consolidation rule that prevents a recurrence: an adapter CAPTURES a
# screen and DESCRIBES its capabilities; it never classifies. A new harness
# shape is taught to fm_composer_classify_screen below, once, and every backend
# that can capture a screen learns it in the same commit.
#
# THE CAPABILITY MODEL: adapters differ in what their capture primitive can
# see, and those differences enter here as DATA (the <caps> argument), never as
# adapter code. Capability differences change how CONFIDENTLY a shape can be
# judged; they never change what the shapes ARE:
#   styled=1    the capture preserves ANSI styling, so ghost/placeholder text
#               is detectable and can be stripped (tmux -e, herdr --format
#               ansi, zellij dump-screen --ansi). With styled=0 (cmux, orca)
#               ghost text is unreadable, so a bare glyph row or left-bar row
#               carrying trailing non-idle text degrades to `unknown` rather
#               than `pending`: the text may be the harness's own idle
#               suggestion, and a false `pending` blocks every safe caller.
#   cursor=1    a cursor row is supplied (tmux #{cursor_y} only). The cursor
#               anchors shape selection: the shape containing the cursor is the
#               composer. Without it, the bottom-most shape wins.
#   identity=1  a native agent identity/state probe exists (herdr `agent get`;
#               the tmux pi foreground-process probe). Identity is what makes
#               Pi's blank separated composer provable; with identity=0 that
#               shape stays `unknown`.
#   rows=<n>    the capture's bounded row count (informational).
#
# THE STRICT BLANK-ROW RULE (captain decision blank-row-injection-posture,
# 2026-08-09): a blank or otherwise unidentified input row with no positive
# container proof is `unknown` and callers defer. This replaced tmux's
# permissive "blank cursor row = empty = safe to inject" rule fleet-wide: a
# blank row under the cursor can be a modal dialog, a dead shell between
# transcript rules, or a mid-redraw pane, and the away-mode injector types
# escalations into whatever it calls empty. Positive container proof means one
# of the shapes in the catalogue below.
#
# THE SHAPE CATALOGUE (all verified against real harnesses; byte-level
# captures in data/fm-composer-consolidation-audit-s1/report.md and
# docs/verification/runtime-backends.md):
#   bordered   - a complete boxed composer: a top border, side-bordered content
#                rows of the same family, and a bottom border (grok, kimi,
#                older claude). The bottom border may carry a TITLE (grok
#                writes its model name there); a titled bottom border that
#                still starts and ends with the family's rule glyph is
#                tolerated, not ambiguity.
#   bare       - an agent prompt glyph row with no border at all (claude `❯`,
#                codex `›`, muse `⟩`, cursor `→`). The agent glyph is itself the container
#                proof; a bare SHELL glyph (`>` `$` `%` `#`) never is.
#   left-bar   - opencode: rows prefixed by a heavy left bar `┃` with no
#                closing border, holding the idle hint, blank rows, and a
#                mode/model footer line.
#   separated  - pi: content rows between two solid horizontal `─` rules, no
#                glyph and no side border. Provable only with a live agent
#                identity reporting an idle/done pi (herdr `agent
#                get`; the tmux foreground-process probe), because a blank
#                region between two transcript rules is otherwise exactly the
#                strict rule's unidentifiable blank row.
#
# THE SAFETY RULE for glyphs: a bare shell prompt glyph (`>` `$` `%` `#`) -
# what a pane shows once its agent has exited to a plain login shell - is a
# genuine empty agent composer ONLY inside a bordered container. On a bare row
# it is a dead-shell prompt and classifies `unknown` (never a safe injection
# target). The AGENT glyphs `❯` (claude), `›` (codex), `⟩` (U+27E9, muse),
# and `→` (U+2192, cursor) are a genuine empty agent composer either way.
# Both glyph sets are declared
# exactly once below; every decision reaches them through the declarations.
#
# GHOST/PLACEHOLDER TEXT (task afk-herdr-false-pending): a harness fills an
# otherwise-empty composer with de-emphasized ghost text - claude's rotating
# prompt suggestion, codex's idle suggestion, grok's placeholder, or cursor's
# idle placeholder - which a
# plain capture cannot tell apart from text a human typed.
# fm_composer_strip_ghost is the ONE ANSI-aware extractor of "real typed
# content": it drops every de-emphasized run - dim/faint (SGR 2) AND a
# dark/muted TRUECOLOR foreground - and keeps only normal-intensity,
# normally-coloured text.
#
# UNICODE WHITESPACE (issue #1988; open PRs #1995/#2047 target the same
# defect and #1995's naming is adopted here so the implementations converge):
# a harness may separate its prompt glyph from composer content with a
# non-ASCII space. Real claude 2.x draws its EMPTY composer as exactly `❯`
# followed by U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE. POSIX `[[:space:]]` includes U+00A0 only
# under some locales, so every trim used to be locale-dependent: the same live
# pane read `empty` under a UTF-8 shell and `pending` under LC_ALL=C (a
# daemon, launchd, or ssh context), deferring every away-mode escalation.
# fm_composer_normalize_trim_var is the one fix: it maps every code point
# Unicode gives the property White_Space=Yes outside ASCII onto a plain ASCII
# space before any trim or comparison, byte-exactly, so the verdict cannot
# depend on the ambient locale. Glyph strips use literal byte-exact pattern
# removal for the same reason: `${v#?}` removes one BYTE under LC_ALL=C and
# one CHARACTER under UTF-8, which used to leave partial multibyte residue.
#
# Re-sourcing is a cheap idempotent redefinition, so this file needs no
# include guard (matching bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh).

# fm_composer_strip_ansi: drop every CSI escape sequence, leaving plain text.
# Used for STRUCTURAL row/shape detection, where ghost text must be KEPT so the
# composer box border or bare prompt glyph is still visible; content extraction
# uses fm_composer_strip_ghost instead. Reads the styled text on stdin and prints
# plain text (stdin-only, matching fm_composer_strip_ghost). The character class
# includes ':' so an ITU colon-form SGR (38:2::r:g:b) is stripped whole, not left
# with a dangling tail.

# Every code point Unicode gives the property White_Space=Yes that lies OUTSIDE
# ASCII, as UTF-8 byte sequences. Built from octal escapes rather than written
# literally so each entry stays reviewable in source instead of being an
# invisible character:
#   U+0085 NEXT LINE                  U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE
#   U+1680 OGHAM SPACE MARK           U+2000..U+200A EN QUAD..HAIR SPACE
#   U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR             U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR
#   U+202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE      U+205F MEDIUM MATHEMATICAL SPACE
#   U+3000 IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE
# ASCII whitespace is absent because POSIX `[[:space:]]` already covers it.
# U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE is deliberately absent: Unicode gives it
# White_Space=No (a format character), so listing it would substitute this
# owner's own guess for the property it claims to follow. The live harness
# guard (bin/fm-test-run.sh, live-harness-optin) is what catches a harness
# that starts drawing its composer with a character outside this property.

#   - dim/faint runs (SGR 2): how claude and codex render ghost/suggestion text.
#     A reset (SGR 0) or normal-intensity (SGR 22) ends a dim run.
#   - dark/muted TRUECOLOR foreground runs (SGR 38;2;r;g;b or the colon form
#     38:2::r:g:b) whose perceived luminance (0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B) is below
#     FM_COMPOSER_GHOST_LUMA_MAX (default 128): how grok renders its placeholder
#     and hint text. A reset (SGR 0), a default-foreground (SGR 39), any base
#     foreground colour (30-37 / 90-97), or a lighter 38;2 foreground ends the
#     dark-foreground run. This assumes a DARK terminal theme, the firstmate
#     fleet reality, where real typed input is bright and only de-emphasised UI
#     is dark; the SGR-2 signal above stays theme-independent. A 256-colour
#     foreground (38;5;n) is NOT luminance-tested - it is palette-dependent and
#     no fleet harness uses it for ghost text, so it is kept (real text wins:
#     under-stripping merely defers, which the max-defer alarm surfaces, while
#     over-stripping would inject over real input).
# Raising FM_COMPOSER_GHOST_LUMA_MAX is not free: muse draws its `⟩` prompt glyph
# in truecolor 38;2;90;160;255, luminance ~149.9 (verified, muse 0.1.0-R708.1),
# the tightest margin over the 128 default in the fleet. Above ~150 that glyph is
# stripped as ghost text, which is why the bare-glyph fallback below must also
# recognise every agent glyph from the UNSTRIPPED plain row.
# The dim/faint and dark-foreground states are tracked together as "de-emphasis";
# codes are processed left to right within a sequence, so "ESC[0;2m" reads as dim.
# LC_ALL=C makes awk walk bytes, so multibyte glyphs (e.g. ❯) and de-emphasised

# --- Delivery-only rendered busy footers (backend-agnostic) -------------------
#
# These live here, in the ONE shared composer/delivery owner, rather than in any
# single backend adapter, because every backend needs them for the SAME job:
# proving a submitted Enter actually landed. Keeping them in bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh
# made cursor's signature reachable only from tmux, even though herdr, zellij,
# cmux, and orca run the same harnesses and face the same acknowledgement
# problem.
#
# This is a DELIVERY guard, deliberately NOT a worker-state source. The semantic
# busy contract - what firstmate records and supervises on - is owned by
# bin/fm-busy-lib.sh, which forbids classifying a harness from rendered text.
# Matching a footer to confirm a keystroke landed is a different question from
# asking what a worker is doing, and the two must not be conflated.
# Delivery-only rendered busy footers per harness. claude/codex: "esc to
# interrupt"; opencode: "esc interrupt"; pi: "Working..."; grok: "Ctrl+c:cancel".
# Claude's current spinner has a rotating glyph and word, but every active-turn
# line has an ellipsis followed by a parenthesized elapsed duration. Keep this
# signature separate from the shared default because that shape is not generic
# enough to classify arbitrary harness output safely.
# Kimi's anchored moon-phase spinner is separate because bare moon glyphs in
# ordinary output must not classify another harness as busy. Leading whitespace is
# OPTIONAL; whitespace on both sides of the separator is REQUIRED because every
# captured spinner row had it. A zero-whitespace form has NEVER been observed and
# is deliberately not matched. The line end is intentionally unanchored because
# rotating tip text follows and is not required to be present. The idle status
# bar's lowercase `thinking` label and independently rotating tip text are not
# busy signals on their own.
# The full moon-phase set remains locale- and emoji-font-sensitive because Kimi
# exposes no stable ASCII busy token.
# The harness-less default is the UNION of the per-harness tokens below, used
# when a caller has no recorded harness for the pane (the submit cores read the
# baseline and the post-Enter transition this way). cursor's `ctrl+c to stop` is
# part of that union for the same reason the others are: without it a cursor
# submit could never be acknowledged, because cursor parks its terminal cursor
# outside its composer and the composer verdict is therefore always `unknown`.

# The pi separated-shape verdict: identity + structure conjunction (herdr's
# rule, now fleet-wide). A missing identity capability keeps the shape
# unknown; an unfetched identity on an identity-capable backend asks the
# adapter to probe (lazily) and re-call. Proven input remains pending for every
# live pi state, while only an idle/done pi proves an empty composer. A blocked
# pi is parked on an interactive prompt waiting for a human keystroke: its menu
# is drawn above the separator pair, so the composer region looks free while the
# keys would answer the prompt instead of composing (issue #2797). Structure
# cannot disprove that, so a blocked pi defers rather than claiming empty.
