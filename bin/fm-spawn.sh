# Spawn a direct report: a crewmate in a treehouse or Orca worktree, or a
# secondmate in its isolated firstmate home.
# Usage: fm-spawn.sh <task-id> <project-dir> --mode <no-mistakes|direct-PR|local-only> --yolo <on|off> [--harness <name>|harness|launch-command] [--model <name>] [--effort <level>] [--backend <name>]
#        fm-spawn.sh <task-id> <project-dir> --scout [--harness <name>|harness|launch-command] [--model <name>] [--effort <level>] [--backend <name>]
#        fm-spawn.sh <task-id> [<firstmate-home>] [--harness <name>|harness|launch-command] [--model <name>] [--effort <level>] [--backend <name>] --secondmate
#   --mode and --yolo are this task's delivery contract, REQUIRED for every ship
#   spawn and refused on --scout and --secondmate spawns. Firstmate resolves both
#   per task at intake (AGENTS.md section 7); data/projects.md holds the captain's
#   standing posture as context, not as this task's answer, so a spawn never looks
#   the mode up. A ship spawn additionally reads the brief's recorded
#   "Delivery contract: mode=<mode>" line and REFUSES a mismatch, so the worker's
#   instructions and the recorded task delivery cannot drift apart; a brief
#   scaffolded before that line existed warns once and launches on the flag. When
#   the explicit mode carries less rigor than the project's standing posture, a
#   loud one-line deviation notice is printed and the spawn continues.
#   no-mistakes-prod-only is a registry policy rather than a task mode and is
#   refused as a flag value.
#        fm-spawn.sh <task-id> --relaunch [--harness <name>] [--model <name>] [--effort <level>]
#   --relaunch launches a replacement agent for an EXISTING task into that
#   task's own recorded endpoint and worktree instead of creating either. It is
#   the launch half of the control plane (bin/fm-control.sh relaunch), which
#   owns the checkpoint, the progress note, stopping the previous agent, and the
#   transaction; call fm-control rather than this flag directly unless you are
#   deliberately re-launching an already-stopped task. Every identity axis -
#   backend, kind, project or home, worktree, endpoint - comes from the task's
#   validated state/<id>.meta, so --backend, --scout, --secondmate, a project
#   positional, and batch pairs are all refused alongside it; only harness,
#   model, and effort may change, which is what makes a harness switch one
#   ordinary relaunch. It refuses unless the recorded endpoint is positively
#   agent-free on a backend with a recovery-grade agent-state classifier (tmux
#   or herdr), refuses unless the endpoint's shell is sitting in the recorded
#   worktree, and clears the previous harness's per-task wiring before arming
#   the new incarnation.
#   --harness <name> is the explicit per-spawn harness/profile adapter. The old
#   positional harness arg still works for back-compat.
#   --model <name> and --effort <low|medium|high|xhigh|max> are concrete profile
#   axes chosen by firstmate at intake. They are only threaded into harnesses whose
#   installed CLIs were verified to support that axis; unsupported axes are omitted
#   from that harness's launch rather than guessed.
#   --backend <name> is the explicit runtime session-provider backend for this
#   exact task only (docs/configuration.md "Runtime backend" owns when that flag
#   is authorized). Without it, the script resolves FM_BACKEND, then
#   config/backend, then runtime auto-detection from the runtime firstmate's
#   environment: $TMUX, HERDR_ENV=1, or cmux runtime signals (via
#   bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_detect, with cmux fallback details in
#   docs/cmux-backend.md),
#   then tmux.
#   Spawn-capable backends are the reference tmux adapter and experimental
#   herdr, zellij, orca, and cmux. Orca owns both the task worktree and
#   terminal, so ship/scout Orca spawns do not run treehouse get; cmux is a
#   session provider only, exactly like herdr/zellij, so it does. An
#   auto-detected herdr or cmux spawn prints a loud stderr notice;
#   auto-detected tmux stays silent; zellij and orca are never auto-detected.
#   codex-app is not a known backend yet; docs/codex-app-backend.md owns that
#   blocked backend contract. Default tmux spawns do not write backend= to meta;
#   absent backend= means tmux. cmux does not support --secondmate spawns yet.
#   A backend spawn refusal (missing dependency, version gate, unauthenticated
#   socket, or unsupported secondmate mode) is terminal for that selected backend;
#   callers must surface it instead of silently retrying another backend.
#   A herdr crewmate or scout is placed in the exact workspace of the firstmate
#   or secondmate process launching it, resolved from that process's own herdr
#   pane rather than from a workspace label (herdr enforces no label uniqueness,
#   so a label cannot tell two "firstmate" workspaces apart). A claimed parent
#   identity that is unreadable, contradictory, stale, or from another herdr
#   session stops the spawn before any worker endpoint exists. A launcher
#   outside herdr has no workspace to inherit and uses this home's own labeled
#   workspace, which must then match exactly one. --secondmate is the deliberate
#   exception: it stands up that secondmate home's own workspace.
#   Herdr additionally uses a presentation-only layout by default when the
#   selected client and running server meet the Herdr 0.8.0 floor. The local
#   config/herdr-presentation-spaces file can say off to disable it or on to
#   opt in below that floor; an empty file remains the historical opt-in form.
#   A clean fresh task first writes state/<id>.herdr-presentation atomically,
#   then creates a disposable
#   workspace containing only the ordinary task pane. A successful clean create
#   upgrades its attempt journal with exact home, session, workspace, tab, pane,
#   parent, and label bindings. On a same-identity restart, that complete binding
#   plus authoritative metadata may replace one exact agent-free husk in place.
#   The journal, visible token, and labels alone are never endpoint or ownership
#   authority, and every ambiguous recovery stays on the flat fallback after
#   duplicate-agent risk is independently absent. Treehouse allocation and task
#   metadata are unchanged.
#   A clean projected create or exact resume makes one bounded attempt to hold
#   the one session-scoped presentation-order lock (keyed by named session plus
#   canonical socket, outside any home's state/) through launch handoff. Lock
#   contention warns and falls back to the ordinary flat layout before any
#   projection mutation. The exact response-derived new workspace is inserted
#   immediately after its owning parent (firstmate or 2ndmate-<id>) contiguous
#   child block. Ordering never authorizes lifecycle cleanup, and any
#   unavailable, ambiguous, or failed move warns while the spawn continues.
#   Every projected create, prune, and move captures and verifies the named
#   session's exact active workspace and tab. A detected focus change restores
#   only that exact tab id; an ambiguous pre-operation snapshot refuses the
#   focus-sensitive presentation mutation.
#   Every single-task invocation holds one task-id-scoped lock across backend
#   creation through metadata publication, so concurrent same-id spawns serialize
#   even when they select different backends. A fresh spawn first takes the
#   per-home task-set lock and refuses rather than waits when forced teardown owns
#   it; relaunch is exempt because the existing task's control lock covers it.
#   With no harness arg, a crewmate/scout spawn resolves the CREW harness only when
#   config/crew-dispatch.json is absent. When that file exists, crewmate/scout
#   spawns require an explicit harness so firstmate cannot silently skip dispatch
#   profile consultation. A --secondmate spawn is exempt and resolves the SECONDMATE
#   harness (config/secondmate-harness -> config/crew-harness -> own), so the
#   secondmate-vs-crewmate split is DURABLE across every respawn (recovery,
#   /updatefirstmate, restart). A bare adapter name (claude|codex|opencode|pi|pi-signed|grok|kimi|cursor|muse)
#   overrides it for this spawn (either kind). A non-flag string containing
#   whitespace is treated as a RAW launch command - the escape hatch for verifying
#   new adapters. For pi and pi-signed, fm-spawn resolves the selected executable
#   name from PATH once, probes that concrete path with --help, and launches the
#   same path. It adds --tui-mode regular only when that help advertises the flag;
#   a failed or inconclusive probe omits it so older Pi versions remain launchable.
#   A missing selected executable refuses before endpoint creation, and pi-signed
#   never falls back to pi.
#   config/secondmate-harness may also carry an optional model and effort as extra
#   whitespace-separated tokens ("<harness> [<model>] [<effort>]"). For a
#   --secondmate spawn, those tokens apply only when this spawn also resolves its
#   harness from config/secondmate-harness. An explicit per-spawn --harness,
#   positional harness arg, or raw launch command starts with clean model/effort
#   defaults unless the caller also passes explicit --model/--effort flags. When
#   the file governs the spawn, its model/effort tokens are re-resolved on every
#   respawn exactly like the harness axis, and explicit --model/--effort flags
#   still win over the file's tokens.
#   A --secondmate spawn also propagates the primary's declared inherited local
#   material, so the secondmate's OWN crewmates inherit primary config and the
#   secondmate receives the primary's read-only shared captain-preference file
#   (fm-config-inherit-lib.sh). A successful launch clears pending inherited
#   config reread generations because the new agent reads the converged files.
#   --scout records kind=scout in the task's meta (report deliverable, scratch worktree;
#   see AGENTS.md task lifecycle); --secondmate records kind=secondmate and launches in a
#   provisioned firstmate home; the default is kind=ship.
#   Before a secondmate launch, the home is locally fast-forwarded to the primary
#   default-branch commit when safe; skipped syncs warn and launch unchanged.
#   Ship/scout spawns refuse to launch unless the resolved task path is a real
#   git worktree root distinct from the primary project checkout.
#   Before a fresh ship or scout worker starts, its clean task worktree fetches
#   origin, resolves the current remote default branch, and resets to its tip.
#   An unreachable origin, unresolved default branch, or non-clean worktree
#   refuses the spawn rather than risking a PR based on stale history.
#   A slot whose only deviation is a stale submodule gitlink is refused by that
#   same clean check, but is reported as a stale checkout naming each submodule
#   and both pins; nothing is converged or removed, and no remedy is suggested.
#   That report is only reached when each submodule's checked-out commit is
#   already contained in one of its remotes, so a submodule carrying an unpushed
#   commit keeps the conservative uncommitted-work refusal instead. That
#   containment test reads local refs only and never fetches, so this gate stays
#   usable offline; a stale remote-tracking ref can therefore make an unpushed
#   commit look contained, which is exactly why no remedy command is printed.
# Batch dispatch: pass one or more `id=repo` pairs instead of a single <id> <project>, e.g.
#     fm-spawn.sh fix-a-k3=projects/foo add-b-q7=projects/bar [--scout]
#   Each pair re-execs this script in single-task mode, so the single path stays the only
#   source of truth; shared --scout/--harness/--model/--effort/--backend/--mode/--yolo
#   applies to every pair. A ship batch therefore carries one delivery contract, and each
#   pair still checks it against its own brief; a batch spanning modes is two invocations.
#   If config/crew-dispatch.json exists, shared --harness is required for crewmate
#   and scout batches. The loop lives here, in bash, so callers never hand-write a
#   multi-task shell loop (the tool shell is zsh, which does not word-split unquoted
#   $vars and silently breaks ad-hoc `for ... in $pairs` loops).
#   Launch templates live in launch_template() below; placeholders replaced before launch:
#     __BRIEF__    absolute path to data/<task-id>/brief.md
#     __PIBIN__    quoted concrete Pi-family executable path resolved from PATH
#     __PITUIMODE__ optional --tui-mode regular when that executable advertises it
#     __TURNEND__  absolute path to state/<task-id>.turn-ended (for harnesses whose
#                  turn-end signal rides the launch command, e.g. codex -c notify=[...])
#     __PIEXT__    absolute path to state/<task-id>.pi-ext.ts (pi turn-end extension,
#                  written by this script; outside the worktree to avoid pi's trust gate)
#     __PITURNEND__ absolute path to .pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts in a pi secondmate home
#     __PIWATCH__   absolute path to .pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts in a pi secondmate home
#     __OPINPUT__   absolute path to the canonical operational-input encoder
#     __WORKTREE__  absolute path to the task worktree
#     __CURSORBIN__ resolved, cursor-verified executable for a cursor launch
# Verified per-harness turn-end hooks are installed automatically where enabled; some live outside the worktree.
# Kimi uses one surgically installed Firstmate region in $HOME/.kimi-code/config.toml,
# a firstmate-owned global hook and registry, and a gitignored per-task pointer.
# grok uses a firstmate-owned global hook under ${GROK_HOME:-$HOME/.grok}/hooks
# plus a gitignored .fm-grok-turnend worktree pointer and a state token.
# muse installs no hook at all - its plugin engine is off in the default build - so
# it writes state/<id>.muse-session to bind the pane to muse's own session event
# log; muse is crewmate/scout only and is refused for --secondmate.
# cursor installs no per-task hook either: it writes state/<id>.cursor-session to
# bind the pane to cursor's own conversation transcript (projects root, the exact
# workspace path cursor records in .workspace-trusted, and the conversations that
# already existed for that workspace). It is launched through the verified binary
# resolver because `cursor` is not the CLI name. A cursor SECONDMATE instead runs
# the tracked project-scope .cursor/hooks.json in its own home, whose stop-hook
# park owns that home's supervision (docs/supervision-protocols/cursor.md).
# Publishing the record and moving this home's backlog item to In flight are one
# step, not two: bin/fm-backlog-transition-lib.sh owns that invariant, and this
# script performs the transition under the task's own meta lock before it reports
# success. A ship or scout dispatch therefore REFUSES up front, before any
# endpoint, worktree, or record exists, unless the home's backlog has an
# unheld, unblocked Queued or In flight item for the id; a transition that fails
# after publication removes the record it just wrote rather than leaving a
# worker the backlog does not own. A relaunch re-reads the row instead of
# re-running the transition, so an eligible In-flight item is left untouched.
# The transition is
# skipped entirely for --secondmate spawns (persistent agents are not work
# items), on a config/backlog-backend=manual home, and in a home that keeps no
# data/backlog.md. An automatic-backend home with a backlog but no compatible
# tasks-axi refuses before creating any lifecycle state.
# On success prints: spawned <id> harness=<name> kind=<ship|scout|secondmate> [mode=<mode> yolo=<on|off>] window=<backend-target> worktree=<path>
# A ship task records the explicit mode/yolo it was passed; a secondmate spawn records
# mode=secondmate, yolo=off, home=, and projects=; a scout records neither, and both the
# success line and state/<id>.meta omit them.
# Every fresh spawn or relaunch records a new spawn_gen= incarnation token so durable
# consumers can distinguish a replacement worker that reuses the same task id.
# When the home session's frozen trace-context decision is enabled (see
# docs/configuration.md and bin/fm-trace-context-lib.sh), the meta also records
# one W3C traceparent= carrier, the same value injected into the pane as
# TRACEPARENT; the default-off path writes neither, leaving the generated meta
# and launch environment unchanged.
#   --traceparent <carrier> delivers a carrier that a REMOTE parent already
#   resolved and will record, instead of resolving one from this home's frozen
#   decision. It is accepted only for --secondmate spawns, only as a strictly
#   validated W3C traceparent, and exists because a remote secondmate's task
#   identity is owned by the parent home that holds its task metadata, while the
#   pane export happens on the remote host (bin/fm-remote-secondmate-control.sh).
#   Local spawns never pass it and resolve their own carrier exactly as before.

# A pooled slot whose only deviation is a submodule gitlink is stale, not dirty:

# the pin the previous base recorded. The refusal still stands and this gate
# never touches the slot; it only names the cause, because "is not clean" while
# the operator's own `git status` reads clean gives neither a cause nor a remedy.
# A pin is only reported as stale when the commit the slot holds is already
# contained in one of the submodule's remotes. Anything that cannot be proven
# contained - an unpushed commit, a submodule with no remote, a git error - falls
# through to the conservative uncommitted-work refusal, as does any entry that is
# not exactly a clean submodule sitting on a different pin. The diagnosis is
# buffered and only emitted once every entry qualifies, so it can never
# contradict the verdict.
#
# No remedy command is printed, deliberately. That containment check reads local
# refs only and never fetches, because this gate has to stay usable offline. A
# remote-tracking ref that has gone stale - its upstream branch deleted or
# force-pushed, and never pruned - therefore still reads as containment, so a
# commit that is really unpushed can look contained. Naming the submodule and both
# pins is what the operator actually needs; printing a checkout command on a
