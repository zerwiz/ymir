# PreToolUse guard against primary-session delegation outside the fleet.
#
# A firstmate primary that delegates through a harness's own delegation,
# scheduling, or background-work tool creates work with no `state/<id>.meta` and
# no `data/<id>/brief.md`. Only `bin/fm-spawn.sh` writes that metadata, and
# untracked project work contributes nothing to the in-flight branch of
# bin/fm-supervision-lib.sh or bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh. So such work is not
# merely unsupervised: absent an independent X-mode need, it makes the whole
# guard stack structurally inert, and it dies with the primary session instead
# of living in its own backend session.
#
# This scoped PreToolUse guard is the shipped mechanism.
# Claude primaries should also use an untracked per-home local
# `permissions.deny` list as hardening for known Claude delegation tools,
# because it removes them from the model's schema entirely.
# That deny list must not be tracked: it is Claude-only rather than
# harness-agnostic, and tracked project settings propagate into linked
# worktrees where they disarm legitimate crewmates.
# The tracked Claude matcher is deliberately `.*`: a stem-enumerating matcher
# would reintroduce the fail-open-by-enumeration problem this guard exists to
# solve, because any future tool name outside the matcher would never reach this
# script.
# This script is therefore the single owner of classification.
# It matches a delegation-SHAPED tool name rather than a fixed list, so a future
# tool that ships before anyone updates a local deny list is still refused.
#
# The guard is narrow by design. It classifies ONE thing: the shape of the tool
# name. It makes no judgment about whether the work should be delegated at all,
# which is a reasoning boundary no tool-shape hook can enforce.
# See docs/subagent-guard.md for the complete contract and validation record.
#
# Usage:
#   <PreToolUse JSON on stdin> | bin/fm-subagent-pretool-check.sh
#   bin/fm-subagent-pretool-check.sh --tool '<tool-name>'
#
# Stdin mode extracts .tool_name for Claude and Codex, or .toolName for Grok.
# CLI mode is for adapters that already hold the tool name (OpenCode, Pi).
#
# Exit/output contract (identical shape to bin/fm-cd-pretool-check.sh):
#   ALLOW - exit 0 and no output.
#   DENY - exit 2, a Claude-shaped deny object on stderr, and a Grok-shaped
#          deny object on stdout unless --claude was supplied.
#   INERT - not a genuine primary home (a crewmate/scout task worktree or a
#           non-firstmate repo): exit 0 with no output, exactly like ALLOW.
#   ESCAPE - FM_ALLOW_SUBAGENT=1 in the environment allows deliberately.
#   FAIL OPEN - malformed or empty stdin, or missing jq for stdin transport.
#
# Claude requires stdout to remain empty on deny.
# Codex blocks on exit 2 and displays stderr.
# Grok consumes the stdout decision object.
# OpenCode and Pi consume exit 2 plus stderr.

# Exact lowercase tool names that match a stem above but only OBSERVE or STOP
# work that already exists. Reading or ending unaccounted work is not creating
# it, and denying these would strand already-running work with no way to inspect
# or end it. A local Claude deny list may still remove these from the
# schema; this shipped guard deliberately stays narrower so it can never be the
# reason a runaway task cannot be stopped.
OBSERVE_ONLY_TOOLS='taskoutput taskstop taskget tasklist cronlist bashoutput killshell'

# Exact lowercase tool names that match a stem above but create no RUNNABLE
# work. These write only the harness's session-local todo list, which has no
# executor: it spawns no agent, allocates no worktree, registers no schedule,
# and starts nothing that could outlive the session or escape a firstmate
# guard. Denying them stops the primary tracking its own plan while granting no
# delegation power, and the deny text would tell it to run bin/fm-brief.sh for a
# todo entry, so the stem match here is a false positive rather than a policy.
# This is a separate list from OBSERVE_ONLY_TOOLS on purpose: these tools WRITE,
# so folding them into a list documented as observe-or-stop would make that
# contract untrue. Both lists are exact-name, never substring, so neither can
# widen by accident.

Usage: fm-subagent-pretool-check.sh [--tool <tool-name>] [--claude]

With no --tool, reads a PreToolUse-style JSON payload on stdin (Claude/Codex
tool_name, or Grok toolName).
Denies a delegation-SHAPED tool name in a genuine primary home.
Claude primaries may also add an untracked per-home permissions.deny list that
removes known delegation tools from the model schema before this hook is needed.
Do not ship that Claude-only list in tracked project settings, because linked
worktrees inherit it and legitimate crewmates would lose their delegation tools.
This hook remains as the shipped guard for future delegation-shaped names
outside any local fixed list.
Fires only in a genuine firstmate primary home; it is a silent no-op in a
crewmate/scout task worktree or any non-firstmate repo, where a worker using
delegation tools is legitimate.
Exits 0 to allow and 2 to deny, naming the real crewmate dispatch path instead.
Set FM_ALLOW_SUBAGENT=1 in the session environment to allow deliberately.
Malformed transport fails open.
