  # Claude, Pi, Grok, and Cursor set verified markers of their own; codex,
  # opencode, Kimi, and Muse are markerless, so a foreign marker retained in a terminal
  # multiplexer's stored environment can silently misidentify one of them before
  # ancestry is consulted. This is a precedence hazard, not evidence that
  # CLAUDECODE inheritance into a kimi child was observed; it was not observed.
  # Cursor is checked BEFORE claude, deliberately. cursor-agent does NOT clear
  # an inherited CLAUDECODE, so a cursor worker launched from a claude primary
  # carries BOTH markers and whichever is tested first wins. Cursor's own
  # markers are unambiguous when present, so ordering them first is what makes
  # the verdict correct; bin/fm-spawn.sh additionally clears the foreign markers
  # at the launch boundary. Both are kept: the launch sanitization only covers
  # sessions fm-spawn started, while this ordering also covers a cursor session
  # a human started by hand. Verified live on cursor-agent 2026.08.11-e8db854:
