# Gná — the one mail desk (production)

**Gná** carries word and brings it back: she is the secretary who reads the accounts
she is scoped to, judges what a message is, and puts it in a queue with a proposed
action and the evidence for it. **She cannot send** — there is no send path in this
directory, and a test fails if one appears.

Law: plan 116 (`svartalfaheim/whynotproductions/projects/ymir/plans/`, in the home).
Page: `docs/features/gna-the-one-mail-desk.md`.

## What is here, and what is private

```
bin/mail/gna_store.py     the store: an account is the boundary; a read without one is refused
bin/mail/gna_judge.py     the judge: six classes · six actions · rules only · evidence always
bin/mail/gna_import.py    the importer: the Gmail API OR IMAP, read-only, one account, --dry-run
bin/mail/gna_addresses.py the register behind the door: DNS MX by hand, routing, arrival proofs
bin/mail/addresses.sh     the addresses the house USES, and whether mail can reach them (--check)
bin/mail/gna_desk.py      the desk: 127.0.0.1:8490, token + account scope, GET only
bin/mail/inbound-test.sh  the acceptance test: send from outside, assert the arrival, or skip
bin/mail/mail-scan.sh     the earlier one-shot read (kept — it proved the door opened)
bin/mail/install.sh       seats the desk as a systemd USER unit, restart-always
bin/mail/tests/           16 proofs, including "no file here can send"
```

The **store and the scope never live here**: they are the home's
(`$YMIR_HOME/hodd/memory/mail/` — `accounts.yaml`, `retention.yaml`,
`messages.jsonl`), and the message spine is git-ignored. Schema, scope and
retention travel; raw mail does not.

## Install and run

```sh
bash bin/mail/install.sh                 # unit: gna-desk.service, enabled, /health proven
bash bin/time/nornir-job-gna-mail.sh --check     # is the desk answering?
bash bin/time/nornir-job-gna-mail.sh --dry-run   # read the mailbox, write nothing
bash bin/time/nornir-job-gna-mail.sh             # import, then prove the desk
python3 bin/mail/tests/test_gna.py               # the proofs
```

The schedule is a Nornir row in the home's `config/cron.yaml`
(`bin/time/nornir-job-gna-mail.sh`), never an absolute path to one machine.

## The four columns

| Column | Meaning | Human act |
|---|---|---|
| **Needs you** | judged, an action proposed, nothing sent | approve · change · dismiss |
| **Unsure** | low confidence, or a sender the book does not know | assign · teach · dismiss |
| **Waiting** | outbound, no answer yet | nudge · close |
| **Done** | a notice recorded, or bulk mail that asked nobody anything | read only |

Every row carries `evidence`: the rule **and the word** that fired.

## The laws, in code

- **No send capability.** No SMTP, no draft creation, no Gmail send endpoint.
  `tests/test_gna.py::NoSendCapability` scans every file here.
- **An account is the boundary.** `require_account()` refuses a blank account and an
  account not declared in the scope file; `get_message()` refuses a message from
  another account's scope. The desk answers 400, not an empty list.
- **Absence is a failure.** `/health` reports counts, the last ingest and the
  declared scope; `nornir-job-gna-mail.sh` writes a FAIL line to
  `state/gna-mail.log` and a Rune when the desk or the mailbox cannot be read.
- **The spine is append-only.** A re-judgment appends a new line for the same `id`;
  readers take the latest. Retention is reported, never silently truncated.
- **Rules first; no model at P0.** A message the rules cannot judge lands in
  **Unsure** with low confidence instead of being guessed at.

## Can anyone mail us? Ask the register, never a document

`bin/mail/addresses.sh` is the door plan 116 §15.3.1 asks for: the addresses the house
*uses*, each measured for MX, routing, and a proven arrival.

```sh
bash bin/mail/addresses.sh            # TOON: address · domain · mx · route · arrived · state
bash bin/mail/addresses.sh --check    # nonzero when an address cannot receive
bash bin/mail/addresses.sh --aliases  # re-measure the Workspace aliases (read-only sendAs)
bash bin/mail/inbound-test.sh         # send from outside, wait, assert — or skip with the reason
```

Three facts per address, and none of them is an assumption:

- **mx** — measured over DNS with the resolver's own query (no `dig` dependency, Rule 07:
  `$GNA_DNS_SERVER`, else `/etc/resolv.conf`). A domain with no MX is `absent`; a Null MX
  (RFC 7505) is a deliberate refusal, not a mailbox.
- **route** — *declared* in the home's `accounts.yaml` under `house:` (routing lives in a
  dashboard, not in DNS), so the register can say "explicit" or "catch-all" honestly.
- **arrived** — *measured*: a proof line in `hodd/state/mail/inbound-arrivals.jsonl`, written
  only by `inbound-test.sh` when a message actually landed with its `To:` intact. Until one
  does, a routed address is **unproven** — `deliverable` is something a machine measured.

`--check` exits `1` when an address is undeliverable, `2` when the register cannot be read,
`3` when everything is reachable but nothing is proven, and `0` only when it is all proven.
Measured 2026-10-24: `zerwiz.org` publishes **no MX at all**, so `gimle@`, `snotra@`,
`reply+*` and `bounce+*` there cannot receive; `way-of.com` publishes Google MX, and the
Workspace aliases do not exist yet — the register says `alias-missing`, naming the console
step, rather than showing an empty inbox.

## The desk's honesty line

`bin/mail/gna_desk.py --honesty` prints, per address, `deliverable · forwarded · unreadable`;
`GET /addresses` returns the same as JSON; `GET /queue` carries it beside the four columns,
with an `inbox_state` per account (`arrivable` · `declared-only` · `cannot-arrive`) and a
`notice` that says why. **An empty queue can never again be mistaken for "no mail" when
nothing could arrive**: the desk renders the reason.

## Reading a mailbox that is not Gmail

An account row names its transport, so a store the house runs itself needs no rewrite:

```yaml
  - id: team@example.org
    transport: imap
    imap:                       # these are NAMES of vault keys, never values
      host_key: GNA_IMAP_HOST
      port_key: GNA_IMAP_PORT   # optional — 993 (IMAPS) when absent
      tls_key:  GNA_IMAP_TLS    # optional — ssl (default) · starttls · none (loopback only)
      user_key: GNA_IMAP_USER
      password_key: GNA_IMAP_PASSWORD
      mailbox: INBOX            # optional
```

The reader opens the mailbox with `EXAMINE` (`readonly=True`) and never issues STORE, COPY,
EXPUNGE, APPEND or DELETE — a test asserts it against a real fixture IMAP server. A row that
declares `transport: imap` with no `imap:` block is **refused** ("no IMAP account is
declared"), a key named but absent from the vault is refused by name, and plaintext TLS off
loopback is refused outright.

## Not built yet (plan 116, in order)

Drafts and approvals (P1) on the same gate · a second account with its own grant
(P2) · the agent door `mail_search · mail_thread · mail_draft` (P3) · rules that
earn their place (P4). None of them may add a send path.
