# home-seed.sh — make a home that a fresh user can understand, and offer to keep it in git.
#
#   bin/engine/home-seed.sh                 explain, create the skeleton, print what it made
#   bin/engine/home-seed.sh --check         say what is missing, change nothing
#   bin/engine/home-seed.sh --repo          also `git init` it as a PRIVATE repository
#   bin/engine/home-seed.sh --yes           never prompt (takes --repo only when given)
#
# WHY (his word, 2026-11-02): *"if the users are missing ymir home it hsoule make the folders and repo if the
# users wanna. rigtnow it seems like he done understands on a fresch install what ymir home are."*
#
# A new operator is told "everything private lives in your home" and then meets an empty directory they were
# expected to design. This door answers the three questions plainly — WHAT the home is, WHERE it lives, WHAT
# goes in it — creates the skeleton the rest of the house expects, writes the two documents that explain it,
# and offers to make it a private git repository so the home can follow the user to another machine.
#
# It never deletes and never overwrites: a file that exists is left exactly as it is.

This is the **one private place** Ymir keeps on this machine: my identity, memory, plans, secrets, documents and
workspaces. It is deliberately **outside** the Ymir code tree — the code is public, this is mine.

**Keep it private.** If this home is a git repository, make it a **private** one. Never commit a decrypted
secret; `hodd/secrets/platform.env.age` may be committed, a plaintext `platform.env` may not.

**Move it, do not delete it.** An update never removes anything here; to carry it to another machine, copy the
whole directory (or push the private repository) and point `YMIR_HOME` at it.
