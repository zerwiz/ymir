# garmr-bite.sh — GARMR'S TEETH. The hound may contain, within a written allowlist.
#
# Plan 98 §"the bite". Detection without containment leaves the door open while the Allfather
# sleeps; containment without law turns a guard into the hole. So a bite is:
#
#   · PRE-APPROVED   — it must match a rule in the rules file; an unmatched finding is a BARK
#   · RECORDED FIRST — a Rune with the intent, the target and the UN-BITE command is carved
#                      BEFORE the act, and the result after (a bite that cannot be written down
#                      is not taken)
#   · REVERSIBLE     — every bite names its undo; if the undo is unknown, no bite
#   · NEVER THE OPERATOR'S HANDS — not his terminal session, not an open vault, not a unit-less
#                      process he started, not a model mid-generation
#   · ANNOUNCED      — Gná carries it at CRITICAL with the un-bite in the message
#   · LOCAL ONLY     — nothing leaves the machine. A blocked destination is a door WE closed,
#                      never a counter-strike
#
# The switch (GARMR_BITE, from the guardian config) is the Allfather's:
#   off      bark only — today's behaviour, the safe default on a new machine
#   report   bark AND say what it would bite (the shipping default)
#   contain  perform the allowlisted bite
#   hard     contain, and stop the unit that caused it
#
# Usage:
#   garmr-bite.sh status                     # the switch, the allowlist, the last bites
#   garmr-bite.sh allowlist                  # exactly what may be bitten, and how it is undone
#   garmr-bite.sh plan [--findings FILE]     # what it WOULD bite now (no side effects, ever)
#   garmr-bite.sh contain [--dry-run]        # perform the allowlisted bites allowed by the switch
#   garmr-bite.sh advise [--findings FILE]   # the model ADVISES one allowlisted bite; the rules dispose
#   (hound.model: on in guardian.yaml puts the advisor in the RESPONSE path for an uncovered CRITICAL)
#   garmr-bite.sh undo <rune-checksum|id>    # run the recorded un-bite for one bite
#
# Exit: 0 ok · 1 a refusal or a fault · 2 usage · 3 the switch forbids acting

# The Allfather's clarification: use the model to stop an attack — to close a door. That is the
# lawful counter (containment inside our own house), and the model's place in it is narrow on
# purpose:
#   · it may choose ONLY from the six allowlisted bites, and "none";
#   · it never executes anything — the deterministic layer performs the bite, with its undo;
#   · it sees METADATA ONLY (class · severity · pid · port · path · dst), never the payload,
#     because text from an attacker in front of a model is a way to make the defender close the
#     door the attacker wants closed;
#   · an answer outside the allowlist is discarded — a model that cannot answer in the allowlist
#     is not an advisor, it is a risk.
# GARMR_ADVISOR_CMD makes the advisor injectable (tests stub it; a seat with no model sets it empty).
