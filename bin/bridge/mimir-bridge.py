"""mimir-bridge.py — the HTTP face of the well (Mimirsbrunn / engram, :4602).

The upstream engram engine ships a CLI and an MCP (stdio) server, but the rest
of Ymir — the gate API, `bin/records/mimir.sh`, `bin/records/mimir-ingest.sh`, the session
start — speaks a small HTTP contract on 127.0.0.1:4602. This bridge is that
face: a long-lived HTTP server wrapping the `engram` library over one
`.engram` store.

Endpoints:
  GET  /health                 -> {status, store, episodes, agents, last_*}
  GET  /recall?q&k&mode        -> {results:[{score, distance, importance, episode}], slice}
       also: store=, tag= (repeatable), since=, until=, agent_id=, include_archived=1
  POST /observe {content,...}  -> {id, stored, gate, store, tags}
  POST /correct {original_id, content,...} -> {id, corrects}
  POST /retract {original_id, why}         -> {id, retracts}
  GET  /grade?apply=0|1        -> the continuous forgetting pass (report by default)
  GET  /timeline?entity=       -> {facts:[...]}
  GET  /inspect                -> {episodes, agents, store}

WHAT IS NEW (plan 136). A write is now a DECISION: the gate in
`bin/records/mimir-policy.py` asks whether it changes future behaviour, is a
commitment with consequences, or is a decision with rationale, and drops what
answers none. It then canonicalizes, deduplicates, scores by novelty and task
relevance, types the episode (episodic · semantic · procedural) and stamps its
provenance (source, scope, confidence, privacy, retention) as tags the whole
house already reads. Recall is scoped BEFORE it searches: a recency, type and
tag slice is built from the store, the similarity search runs inside it, and a
voided or archived episode is never handed back as fact. Corrections and
retractions APPEND and chain by id (Rule 20) — nothing is erased.

No secrets here; the store is in the hoard. Stdlib only (plus the engine).

    the engine's provenance columns (`provenance`, `quarantined`, added upstream in
    engdbram 3.0) and an index on `timestamp`, because scoped recall filters by
    recency BEFORE it searches — an unindexed scan is how a slice becomes a
    full-table walk as the well grows. Both are additive; neither rewrites a row.
