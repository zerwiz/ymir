# inventory.sh — the honest index of the two shelves nobody can read.
#
# WHY (2026-10-02): the Allfather asked *"do we have a readme in the bin folder and backend
# folder over what every file are doing?"* — one existed, and it was worthless:
#
#   files in bin/            389
#   entries in bin/README.md 105     ← 284 files with no entry at all
#   entries ending mid-sentence  6     ← truncated headers
#   a generator                    none  ← it was hand-written once
#   a checker                      none  ← so it silently rotted
#
# This writes BOTH inventories from the files themselves, and `--check` fails when the
# shelf and the index disagree — so the index cannot rot again.
#
# Per file it reports, all measured rather than judged:
#   does        the file's own header, first COMPLETE sentence
#   kind        door · lib · tool · provenance(fm-*) · module
#   verdict     tested · wired · internal · orphan        (liveness, strongest first)
#   disposition keep · migrate → src/ymir_runtime/<mod> · retire · provenance
#   called-by   the doors that invoke it
#
#   bin/gates/inventory.sh            # write bin/README.md and .agents/backend/README.md
#   bin/gates/inventory.sh --check    # fail if either index is stale (for CI)
set -uo pipefail

# Walk UP until we find the repo, rather than assuming one level. `bin/gates/capabilities.sh` and
# `bin/gates/capabilities.sh` BOTH have to work, and the difference is depth — a fixed `..`
# made the nested copy resolve ROOT to `bin/`, so it looked for `bin/*.sh` inside `bin/`,
# found nothing, and rendered a 2-row register over a 400-door house. Nesting must not be able

# ---- corpus: everything that can prove a file is alive -----------------------
# TWO bugs lived here (2026-10-02), and CI caught the second:
#
#   1. The roots were `agents` and `pi` — DIRECTORIES THAT DO NOT EXIST. The real shelves
#      are `.agents` (723 tracked files) and `.pi` (57), so the single largest body of
#      proof-of-alive evidence in the house was silently excluded from every verdict.
#   2. A `find`/`os.walk` corpus includes gitIGNORED files, so a machine with local state
#      (`.agents/state/`, `.agents/skills-local/`, `.opencode/node_modules/`) renders a
#      DIFFERENT index than a fresh checkout. CI then reads the committed index, finds it
#      stale, and fails — correctly — for a difference no reviewer can see in the diff.
#
# So the corpus is now `git ls-files`: TRACKED files only. A generated index must be
# reproducible from a clean checkout by construction, or its `--check` is a lottery.
