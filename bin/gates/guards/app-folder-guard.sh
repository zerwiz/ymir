# app-folder-guard.sh — Rule 23: no code in an application's folder, and no
# application's folder inside bin/.
#
# Why (2026-10-18): a display/opening tool was written into `bin/desktop/` — a
# directory named after an APPLICATION — because a file it was modelled on happened to
# live there. The Allfather's verdict: *"we can't have random code in the application
# folders."* The rule is RULES/23; this is the ward that makes it bite instead of
# asking nicely.
#
# What it refuses:
#   1. a DIRECTORY under bin/ named after an application          (bin/desktop/)
#   2. an app-named FILE under bin/ whose name carries no function (bin/desktop/smidja.sh)
#   3. a layer's own tool sitting inside apps/<app>/               (apps/x/desktop-place.sh)
#
# What it allows, deliberately:
#   * <app>-<function>.sh shims in the layer that deploys the app — the layer owns the
#     deployment and the app owns the logic (sessrumnir-ensure.sh · smidja-observe.sh)
#   * an app's own launch door (sessrumnir.sh), because launching IS its function
#   * bin/pi/ … — a harness integration namespace, not one of our apps
#
# Usage: app-folder-guard.sh check [path…]   (default: bin/ and apps/)
#        app-folder-guard.sh --list-apps
#        app-folder-guard.sh --version
# Exit: 0 clean · 1 a finding · 2 usage.
