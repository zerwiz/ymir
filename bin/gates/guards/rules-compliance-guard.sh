# rules-compliance-guard.sh — a push proves the house's own rules were followed.
#
# Why this exists: RULES/ 01–46 are law, and until now a push was judged by wards that
# each knew ONE rule (numbering, weave, language, the ward's own list). Nothing asked the
# cheap universal questions every new document must answer:
#
#   R1  a NEW document carries its history            (RULES/06; home RULES/changelog)
#   R2  a new RULE names itself and is indexed        (RULES/README.md)
#   R3  a new document carries no internal address
#       and no plain-HTTP cross-host URL              (home RULES/network.md N1/N7; RULES/39)
#   R4  a new door is executable and has a shebang    (RULES/12, RULES/23)
#
# It judges the PUSH RANGE only (what this push adds), so a legacy tree is never
# re-litigated. Every refusal names file and line — a gate that prints a summary is a
# gate nobody can act on.
#
# Usage: rules-compliance-guard.sh [check] [BASE] [HEAD]
# Exit: 0 clean or clean-skip · 1 a rule is broken · 3 cannot determine the range
