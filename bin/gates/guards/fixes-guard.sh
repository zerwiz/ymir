#
# What it replaces, and why: `changelog-guard` passed if a push range merely
# *touched* CHANGELOG.md — a stray line satisfied it, so it never verified that
# anything was recorded. And the hook in front of it FOLDED fragments into the
# monolith, mutating the tree mid-push and then demanding a commit for the edit it
# had just made.
#
# This gate only READS. A push must carry at least one new fix note
# (`docs/fixes/<component>/<version>-<slug>.md`), and it says which of the push's
# touched paths that note's component covers — a mismatch is reported, never
# silently accepted.
