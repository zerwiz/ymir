#
# Two shapes, because this tree has two kinds of code and each fails differently:
#
#   1. A SOURCE FILE with no importer — a module, component or package file nothing reads.
#      It claims a surface is rendered or an API is used. This is the shape that occurred:
#      three components written for tickets, documented, and imported by nothing.
#
#   2. A SHELL FUNCTION defined and never called — it claims a capability the scripts have.
#      In a tree with ~1,900 scripts that is the common form of the same lie.
#
#   dead-code-guard.sh check     # the ward (used by bin/gates/guards.sh)

#   dead-code-guard.sh --list  # what this ward scans, and what it cannot see
#
# Exit: 0 clean · 1 findings · 2 usage.
#
# ── WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE, stated so nobody assumes it does ────────────────────
#   · an export used only inside its own file
#   · a branch that can never be reached
#   · a constant nothing reads
#   · a file reached only through a string built at runtime
# Those are dead code by the rule. This ward catches the shapes that actually occur, and a
# ward that claims more than it checks is the failure the rule exists to stop.
