# vault-guard.sh — nothing may copy content OUT of the vault (Rule 15).
#
# Hnitbjörg may hold work under NDA. While it is OPEN this ward hashes every file
# inside the mount and refuses to commit any file — in this tree or the home —
# whose content matches a vault file verbatim. Installed as a pre-commit hook in
# both trees, so git runs it on every commit, including the hasty ones.
#
# The honest limit (Rule 15): a machine can catch a file copied out whole; it cannot
# catch a screenshot, a paraphrase, or a paste into a remote model. Those are the
# operator's and the agent's discipline; this raises the floor.
#
#   vault-guard.sh            # scan the staged change (pre-commit)
#   vault-guard.sh --all      # scan every tracked file
#
# Exit: 0 clean, or the vault is sealed (nothing to leak)
#       1 a file copies the vault verbatim
