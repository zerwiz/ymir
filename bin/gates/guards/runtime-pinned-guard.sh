# runtime-pinned-guard.sh — a unit that executes from a WORKING tree is a machine running whatever branch
# the last agent left checked out.
#
# Rule: RULES/02 §7 (appended 2026-11-02). Measured that day: ten user units pointed at the operator's own
# working tree (his home directory, the checkout agents switch branches in) — so a `git checkout` changed the
# model bridge, the MCP face, the warden and the assistant were running, silently, with no approval.
#
#   bash bin/gates/guards/runtime-pinned-guard.sh [check]
#
# Exit 0 when every unit that names the tree names a PINNED checkout, and that checkout stands on the default
# branch. A seat with no user units (a hand, a CI runner) SKIPs at exit 0 — a clean skip is a pass (RULES/25).

# Ask git about ANOTHER checkout without the caller's repository in the way. This ward runs
# inside the pre-push hook, and git exports GIT_DIR (and friends) to a hook: with GIT_DIR set,
# `git -C <other tree>` answers about the PUSHING tree, not the one it was pointed at. Measured
# 2026-11-02 — the first push from a worktree was refused with "the pinned runtime stands on
# yggdrasil/<branch>, not main", about a runtime that was standing on main: the ward read the
# pushing branch and blamed the operator's runtime for it. Every push this house makes comes
# from a worktree (Rule 08), so the gate refused all of them.
