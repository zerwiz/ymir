#!/usr/bin/env bash
# doc-sweep.sh — the shelf-sweeper (plan 63): find the operator's documents, inside
# the home and outside it, and PROPOSE where each one belongs. Then, and only then,
# move what a human has read and signed for.
#
#   doc-sweep.sh scan [root ...]        REPORT ONLY — classifies, proposes, writes nothing else
#   doc-sweep.sh apply --plan <file>    moves ONLY the MOVE lines of that plan; idempotent
#   doc-sweep.sh verify [--plan <file>] re-checks BY NAME that every applied file is where the plan said
#
# The laws, and they are the work:
#   * Nothing moves without a word. `scan` writes no file but its report; `apply` reads the
#     PLAN for what to move, never the filesystem. There is no --force and no --all, and
#     there is no "put it somewhere sensible".
#   * The repo stays clean: every destination must resolve inside the home, read through
#     the ONE resolver (bin/vault/hoard-lib.sh) — never a literal path, never $HOME/Documents.
#   * Never delete. A symlink, a socket and a binary are REPORTED; a duplicate is reported
#     as a duplicate; nothing is ever resolved by removing one.
#   * A machine never files into the plan ledger: a plan-shaped document is PROPOSED there.
#   * Staging is by NAME, always — this script stages nothing, and its report names every
#     path it would touch so a human can `git add` them one by one.
#
# Classification, by evidence, in this order: a path naming a known project in
# hodd/identity/projects.yaml → that project's shelf; a plan-shaped or numbered-plan
# document → the plan ledger, PROPOSED only; a note carrying a known domain
# (marketing · personal · work · meetings) → hodd/life/<domain>/; anything else is
# reported as UNPLACEABLE, with the reason it could not be placed. An unplaceable file
# is never dumped into docs/.
#
# Before those four classes, one ward: an item that is not a document — a symlink, a
# socket, a device, a binary, an archive, a credential by name, an operating-system
# folder, the vault itself — is REPORTED and never moved, whatever its name looks like.
#
# The report IS a plan file. Every line is one of
#   MOVE    <from>  ->  <to>   because: <reason>
#   PROPOSE <from>  ->  <to>   because: <reason>     (a machine proposes; only a word moves)
#   REPORT  <from>                        because: <reason>     (never moved, by law)
# so `bin/gates/doc-sweep.sh scan "$root" > plan.txt` hands the operator a plan, and
# `bin/gates/doc-sweep.sh apply --plan plan.txt` moves exactly the MOVE lines in it.
#
# Env:
#   YMIR_HOME / YMIR_HOARD / YMIR_STATE_DIR  the resolver's answers (bin/vault/hoard-lib.sh)
