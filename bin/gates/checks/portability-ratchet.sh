# portability-ratchet.sh — the GNU-only callers may go DOWN, never up.

#
# WHY A RATCHET AND NOT A WALL. Measured 2026-11-02: `stat -c` in 43 files, `sha256sum` in 43, `flock` in 10,
# `mapfile` in 7, `setsid` in 6, `nproc` in 5, `sed -i` in 4, `md5sum` in 3 — 121 callers, and only 24 files
# sourcing the shim. Fixing all of them in one change is a rewrite with no test; forbidding new ones is one
# file of arithmetic and can start today. Each count is compared against a baseline recorded in the home
# (`hodd/data/portability-baseline.yaml`) and the ward fails when a count RISES.
#
#   bash bin/gates/checks/portability-ratchet.sh [check] [--write-baseline]
#
# Exit: 0 within baseline · 1 a count rose · 2 usage.
