# home-contract-check.sh — the contract that raises a home is itself checked.
#
# WHY (RULES/42). The contract is how a user's home receives the files the runtime reads.
# It can rot in five ways, and each is silent: a row naming a template that was moved or
# never shipped; a row naming a door that does not exist; a required file with no shape
# anywhere; a TEMPLATE NOBODY RECEIVES, a shape that ships to every user and is copied into
# no home because no row names it; and — the widest, at ten thousand downloads — a template
# the npm package does not carry, so the install most users take cannot raise the home.
#
#   home-contract-check.sh            # judge the contract
#   home-contract-check.sh --list     # print the rows, tab-separated
#
# There is ONE parser of the contract and it lives in bin/engine/home-seed.sh: this door
# calls it, so a shape that reads well here cannot read differently when a file is seeded
# (two parsers is two truths).
#
# Exit: 0 clean · 1 a finding · 2 usage.
