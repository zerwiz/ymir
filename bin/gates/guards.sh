# guards.sh — every TREE ward, in one command.

# The pre-push hook and BOTH CI hosts call this, so the set of wards has exactly one home:
# adding a ward means adding a line here, and nowhere else. A ward judges the tree and exits
# non-zero when it finds a fault; this only aggregates.
#
# Usage:
#   guards.sh          # run every tree ward
#   guards.sh --list   # name them
#
# Exit: 0 every ward clean · 1 a ward found a fault · 2 usage.

# weave-guard (2026-11-04, plan 175 §3): the weaver was seated and NOTHING CALLED IT — so a stale
# index (RULES/README.md, a plan row, a feature page's catalogue row) was refused by no ward at all.
# It runs weave.sh --check and refuses, naming the gap; it never fixes, because a silent fix hides
# the hand-edit that caused the drift. The hook is convenience, CI keeps the last word.
#
# skills-share-guard (2026-11-04, plan 184): the skills door serves a BUILT copy, and a redaction
# pass trusted to be complete is how a hostname leaves in a footnote. The ward refuses machine
# paths, addresses, LAN hosts, ports, our people, mailboxes, phones, bench tables and our catalog's
# model ids over `hodd/skills-share/published/` — the last word is a refusal, not a review. It
# skips cleanly (and says so) on a machine that has published nothing yet.
# path-legality-guard (2026-11-03): a tracked NAME must be legal on every host RULES/05 claims —
# a `:` NTFS cannot hold made a Windows clone write no tree at all, for a month, unseen.
# packaging-guard (2026-11-03): every path a shipped installer names must exist — the Windows
# .nsi still named the OLD bootstrapper path after Rule 22 moved the host layers, and the build
# that would have said so (ymir-installers.yml) runs only on a tag nobody had cut.

  # caused, and the deadlock was absolute: the repair could not be pushed either. Measured that
  # night: a branch green on every ward was refused five times with `1 of 1 failing ward(s) are
  # red on origin/main, not on this branch`, which is the gate stating its own exception and then
  # walking past it.
  #
  # The rule now: if every failing ward is ALSO red on origin/main, the branch is clear and the
  # push proceeds, with the finding printed loudly so nobody reads the branch as green. If any
  # failure is the branch's own, the refusal stands. If the baseline could not be measured (no
