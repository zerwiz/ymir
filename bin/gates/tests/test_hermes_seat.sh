# test_hermes_seat.sh — the acceptance test for plan 177 H1/H2/H3: Hermes carries the seat, the
# packet and the digest door — proved WITHOUT staging a real model turn.
#
# What it proves (each an `ok` line, exit non-zero on any `FAIL`):
#   · ~/.hermes/SOUL.md carries the marked ymir-seat block and names THIS seat and THIS operator,
#     read from hodd/identity/seats.yaml and operator.yaml — never a hard-coded name;
#   · the seat's declared agent is not Brokk (Rule 44), and a roster that says brokk is refused;
#   · an unseated config is reported as *unnamed*, never invented (a sandbox render, real code);
#   · .hermes.md exists at the repo root, is git-ignored, and names the seat and the operator;
#   · `hermes mcp list` names `ymir` — the packet is seated;
#   · `python3 bin/mcp/ymir-mcp.py --selftest` lists the doors, and the seat file's door list is
#     EXACTLY the packet's (a seat file naming fifteen doors while the packet registers thirty is
#     the drift this house keeps paying for);
#   · the Gná arm's session side is installed and consented (reported as a note, not a failure:
#     the arm has its own door and its own proof).
#
# What it CANNOT prove without a model turn: that the model actually answers as the seat and uses
# the doors. That sentence is the one a human must close with one Hermes session in the repo — the
# test says so rather than pretending.
#
# A machine without Hermes is a CLEAN SKIP with its reason and exit 0 (RULES/25) — never a silent
# pass that pretends it proved something.
