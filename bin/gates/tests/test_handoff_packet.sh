# The refusals that carry plan 203, all tested here because they ARE the design (§15.3):
#   · a head that MOVED is refused, in §14.1's own words
#   · a changed list that understates the diff is refused, and the omitted path is named
#   · a gate tail that is a claim ("all pass") is refused
#   · a `review[]` block written by a smith is refused — the verdict is the reviewer's
#   · `floor partial` is refused — a partial floor is a refusal waiting to happen
#   · a base with no sha, and a missing packet, are refusals rather than silent passes
