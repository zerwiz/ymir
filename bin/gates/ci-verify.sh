# ci-verify.sh — what CI must prove, in one command, for BOTH hosts.
#
# GitHub Actions and Forgejo Actions are two doors to the same room, so neither holds a
# copy of the checks: both call THIS. A workflow that re-listed the steps would be a second
# place for them to drift, which is the failure this whole repository is being taught to stop.
#
# Usage:
#   ci-verify.sh            # run every gate CI owes
#   ci-verify.sh --fast     # skip the heavy one (the real npm install)
#
# Exit: 0 everything proved · 1 a gate failed · 2 usage.
