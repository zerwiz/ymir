# erindi-brief.sh - scaffold an Eindri worker brief at data/<task-id>/brief.md.
#
# Erindi ("the errand") is the written errand Brokk hands an Eindri. The brief
# carries the Setup / Rules / Definition-of-done contract, a fixed machine-
# readable "Delivery contract: mode=<mode>" line, the ISOLATION DECLARATION,
# the status protocol, and the steering-inbox receive/ack section. Ported from
# the upstream distro brief scaffold for plan 29.
#
# The rule (settled 2026-09-24): herdr is the ORDINARY road — a normal deploy
# runs in a herdr workspace in the worktree, with no container. Utgard is the
# EXCEPTION, chosen for untrusted code or an outsized task, never for routine
# work and never merely because an image is present. The brief DECLARES the
# isolation on its own line so einherjar-spawn validates it against reality:
#
#   Isolation: herdr — <why>        (ordinary; the default)
#   Isolation: utgard — <why>       (the exception: untrusted code / outsized load)
#
# The scaffold emits the herdr line; a writer who needs Utgard edits the line
# and says why. The declaration is never inferred from the task text.
# The Definition of done is machine-checkable: every gate is a COMMAND the
# worker runs and whose output it records; where a gate cannot be a command,
# the brief says why.
#
# Usage:
#   erindi-brief.sh <task-id> <repo-name> --mode <no-mistakes|direct-PR|local-only>
#   erindi-brief.sh <task-id> <repo-name> --scout
#   erindi-brief.sh <task-id> --relaunch
#
# --scout writes the scout contract: the deliverable is a report at
# data/<task-id>/report.md (no branch, no push, no PR) and the worktree is
# scratch.
# --relaunch regenerates the brief from the task's recorded state/<id>.meta so
# a replacement Eindri receives the SAME delivery contract as the original; it
# refuses to invent a mode and it will not run without an existing meta record.
# The fixed "Delivery contract: mode=<mode>" line is read by
# bin/einherjar-spawn.sh, which refuses to launch a ship task whose explicit
# --mode disagrees, so an adjusted brief and the recorded task cannot drift.
# --mode is refused on --scout and --relaunch: a scout delivers a report and a
# relaunch re-derives the mode from the task record, not from a flag.
# Refuses to overwrite an existing brief unless --relaunch is given.

# Brokk instruction inbox
Brokk steers you through durable message files in $INBOX_DIR.
When a terminal message says an instruction is waiting there - and at any natural checkpoint when you are unsure - list $INBOX_DIR/*.msg, read and act on each message in numeric order, then acknowledge each handled message by moving it: \`mv $INBOX_DIR/NNN.msg $INBOX_DIR/handled/\`.
The move IS the acknowledgement: without it Brokk rings again and eventually treats you as stuck. An empty or absent inbox needs no action.

STATUS_SECTION=$(cat <<EOF
Report status by appending one line:
   \`echo "{state}: {one short line}" >> $STATUS_FILE\`
   States: working, needs-decision, blocked, $PAUSED_VERB, done, failed.
   Each append wakes Brokk, so report sparingly: only phase changes a supervisor
   would act on and the needs-decision/blocked/$PAUSED_VERB/done/failed states.
   Use \`$PAUSED_VERB: {why}\` - distinct from \`blocked:\` - ONLY when you are deliberately
   idling on a known external wait you expect to clear on its own (an upstream release,
   a rate-limit reset); use \`blocked:\` when you are stuck and need Brokk to act.
   A mid-task \`working:\` line is nonterminal: do not end the turn after it; continue
   until a defined \`done:\` gate under Definition of done.
   A decision or blocker stays open until a \`resolved\` line carrying its exact key
   lands; a later \`done:\` or \`working:\` line never closes it.
   Silence is distinguished from thinking: a worker that stops appending inside
   the window is reported as SUSPECT (bin/eindri-heartbeat.sh) — keep a line
   moving whenever you make progress.

# Setup
You are in a disposable git worktree of $REPO at .yggdrasil/$ID, at a detached HEAD on a clean default branch.

$ISOLATION_SETUP

This is a SCOUT task: the deliverable is a written report, not a PR.
The worktree is your laboratory - install, run, edit, and make scratch commits freely; all of it is discarded at teardown.
The report is the only thing that survives, so anything worth keeping must be in it.

1. First action: confirm where you stand with \`pwd -P\` and \`git rev-parse --show-toplevel\`.

# Rules
1. Never push to any remote and never open a PR.
2. Stay inside this worktree; the only files you may write outside it are the report and the status file below.
3. $STATUS_SECTION
4. If you hit the same obstacle twice, append \`blocked: {why}\` and stop; Brokk will help.
5. If a decision belongs to the Allfather (product choices, destructive actions), append \`needs-decision: {summary of options}\` and stop. Brokk will reply with the decision.
