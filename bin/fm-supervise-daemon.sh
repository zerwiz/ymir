# fm-supervise-daemon.sh — presence-gated sub-supervisor (closes #27's P2).
#
# Wraps bin/fm-watch.sh: runs it as a child, presents and classifies every
# durable wake after an actionable close, acknowledges only after routing, and
# either SELF-HANDLES the routine majority in bash (no firstmate turn) or
# ESCALATES a batched, distilled digest to the supervisor pane on
# captain-relevant events plus bounded declared-wait rechecks. This is the
# token-efficient replacement for the prior always-inject daemon: routine
# signal/stale/heartbeat wakes cost zero firstmate context; only done/
# needs-decision/blocked/failed/persistent-wedge/check-output events and a
# declared-wait recheck reach the LLM, and even then as one pre-read digest per
# batch window.
#
# PRESENCE-GATING (the /afk contract). The daemon is the away-mode engine: it
# injects ONLY when the durable away-mode flag state/.afk is present. Invoking
# the /afk skill sets that flag and starts this daemon; any real (unmarked)
# user message clears it and firstmate resumes full responsiveness.
# When afk is off, normal fm-watch.sh always-on triage is the active mechanism.
# Any buffered daemon escalations that remain while afk is off survive in
# state/.subsuper-escalations and are flushed on the next "while you were out"
# catch-up or when afk is re-entered.
#
# IN-BAND OPERATIONAL INPUT. bin/fm-operational-input.sh constructs every
# current daemon injection as the typed away-supervisor kind after the stable
# FM_OPERATIONAL_PREFIX. A human cannot type its leading U+2063 from a normal
# keyboard at the start of a message, and Herdr transports it as text.
# Firstmate's contract: a message that starts with the current prefix, or a
# legacy bare-marker daemon escalation, is internal (stay afk); an unmarked
# message means the captain is back (exit afk, flush catch-up, resume per-wake
# responsiveness). The prefix and busy-guard solve the same problem - the
# daemon and the human share one input channel - so they live together under
# /afk.
#
# Reliability model (see the /afk skill):
#   - Nothing is lost in away mode: while state/.afk exists, the watcher reverts
#     to daemon-owned one-shot behavior and enqueues every wake to
#     state/.wake-queue BEFORE advancing its suppression markers, so a
#     crash/restart/missed injection is recovered on the next fm-wake-drain.sh.
#     After a watcher cycle, the daemon handles every durable row through that
#     drain and acknowledges it only after routing completes.
#   - Fail-safe-to-escalate: any wake the classifier cannot confidently mark
#     routine is escalated.
#   - Bounded wedge latency: a stale pane without a declared wait is escalated
#     only after it has been idle for STALE_ESCALATE_SECS
#     (configurable), rechecked once. A wedged crewmate is therefore detected
#     within STALE_ESCALATE_SECS + a tick, never lost. A declared wait - either a
#     paused: external wait or a verified captain-held transfer, per
#     fm-classify-lib.sh's combined predicate - instead gets its own longer
#     PAUSE_RESURFACE_SECS recheck, never a wedge escalation, whether its pane
#     reads idle or busy; only a status append that stops declaring the wait
#     ends that routing.
#     Crewmates are autonomous, so a delayed stale response does not stall a
#     healthy crewmate's own progress.
#     Buffered escalation delivery also has a max-defer alarm: if a digest stays
#     undelivered past FM_MAX_DEFER_SECS, the daemon retries a normal flush and
#     writes state/.subsuper-inject-wedged and attempts a configurable active
#     alert if submit still cannot be confirmed.
#   - Cheap heartbeat catch-all: every HEARTBEAT_SCAN_SECS the daemon greps all
#     state/*.status for a captain-relevant line the per-wake classifier might
#     have missed (e.g. a status verb outside CAPTAIN_RE) and escalates it.
#
# The robustness shell from the prior always-inject version is preserved:
# single-instance lock (portable helper, no flock dependency), crash-loop
# backoff, pane-gone guard, and a signal-trapped shutdown that flushes buffered
# escalations before exit.
#
# Usage: fm-supervise-daemon.sh
#          Long-lived background loop. Normally started by the /afk skill, which
#          sets state/.afk first. Env knobs:
#          FM_SUPERVISOR_TARGET     supervisor pane target (override; otherwise
#                                   auto-discovered per backend - $TMUX_PANE
#                                   under tmux, "<session>:<pane-id>" from
#                                   $HERDR_PANE_ID under herdr - then
#                                   firstmate:0 fallback). Accepts either a
#                                   tmux target or a herdr "<session>:<pane-id>"
#                                   target; which one it's read as is decided by
#                                   FM_SUPERVISOR_BACKEND (below), independently.

#                                   $HERDR_ENV=1 selects herdr - falling back to
#                                   tmux). zellij, orca, and cmux are not yet
#                                   supported as supervisor backends; the daemon
#                                   refuses loudly at startup rather than trying
#                                   tmux primitives against a non-tmux pane.
#          FM_INJECT_SKIP           |-prefixes force-self-handle bypassing

#                                   (off|auto|osascript|herdr|command:<cmd>). An
#                                   absent file/var means auto: on macOS that is
#                                   an OS-level notification, so the alarm is
#                                   never silent. See wedge_alarm_notify below
#                                   and docs/configuration.md.
#          FM_WEDGE_ALARM_EXEC      notifier seam: when set, every notifier
#                                   channel routes through this command as
#                                   `<cmd> <channel> <summary>` instead of
#                                   invoking its real notifier; "discard" fires
#                                   nothing. Unset in production. When SOURCED the
#                                   daemon defaults this to "discard" so no test
#                                   can post a real notification (wedge_alarm_emit
#                                   and the library-mode guard at the foot).
#          FM_WEDGE_ALARM_TIMEOUT_SECS seconds allowed for each notifier before
#                                   its watchdog terminates it and continues to the
#                                   next channel (default 10; invalid/zero uses the
#                                   default).
#          FM_INJECT_CONFIRM_RETRIES Enter-retry attempts on a swallowed Enter
#                                   (default 3); the digest is typed once, only
#                                   Enter is retried. Composer-empty detection is
#                                   structural and style-aware (bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh):
#                                   it drops dim/faint ghost text and strips the
#                                   harness's box borders before deciding, so a
#                                   ghost-only or bordered-but-empty composer is
#                                   not misread as pending input.

# --- backend-independent active wedge alert ---------------------------------
# The tmux status-line flash in inject_wedge_alarm below is a cosmetic,
# client-side OSD with no cross-backend equivalent, so a wedged non-tmux primary
# (the 2026-07-10 overnight incident: a claude-on-herdr primary) got NO active
# signal - only the passive state/.subsuper-inject-wedged marker, which nothing
# surfaces until the next fleet action (that night, 20 escalations sat buffered
# for 8.5h). These helpers add a configurable active alert that does not depend
# on any pane or its backend status-line: an OS-level macOS notification, a
# herdr notification, or a captain-supplied command (push to a phone, etc.).
# Every channel is best-effort - a missing or failing channel logs and is
# skipped, never crashing the daemon loop - and the durable marker plus the tmux
# flash stay exactly as before.
#
# Config: config/wedge-alarm (local, gitignored), one channel directive per
# non-empty, non-comment line. FM_WEDGE_ALARM_CHANNEL overrides the file with a
# single directive. Directives:
#   off              disable the active alert entirely, regardless of position
#                    (marker + flash remain)

#     re-peek the pane; still idle -> escalate (wedge); resumed -> clear marker.
#  2b) pause re-surface: for each declared-wait marker past PAUSE_RESURFACE_SECS,

#     -> escalate a recheck digest naming which human the wait is on, and reset
