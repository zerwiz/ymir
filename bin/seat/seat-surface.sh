# WHY (the Allfather, 2026-11-03): *"every machine and user needs to have their own
# names for that agent … it comes a lot of conflicts when several of Brokk exists.
# That needs to be a ymir home config that gets into all tools' AGENTS.md globally
# in installs and updates if they are still named Brokk."*
#
# The shared contract (the repo's AGENTS.md) names the counsellor's craft — Brokk.
# A seat whose primary is a different figure (Sindri on the smith's seat, Kvasir on
# compute, Forseti on the ledger) must NOT answer to that name. So the seat's name is
# a HOME CONFIG (`$YMIR_HOME/hodd/identity/seats.yaml`, read by seat-identity.sh) and
# this door renders it ABOVE the shared contract into one file —
# `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.seat.md` — then points every harness instruction file at it.
#
# It NEVER writes the public repo. The repo contract stays shared; only the machine's
# copy carries the seat's name. Idempotent: safe in install and in every update.
