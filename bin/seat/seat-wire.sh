#
#   bin/seat/seat-wire.sh seats                 # the peers, with reachability
#   bin/seat/seat-wire.sh who <seat>            # the far side's own answer: host · primary · pane · session
#   bin/seat/seat-wire.sh read <seat> [--lines N]   # the peer's pane tail
#   bin/seat/seat-wire.sh say <seat> "<line>"   # deliver one attributed line into the peer's live agent
#   bin/seat/seat-wire.sh wait <seat> [--timeout MS]  # block until the peer leaves `working`
#   bin/seat/seat-wire.sh nudge <seat> "<line>"  # append one attributed line to the peer's wake queue
#
# Law (plan 189):
#   * a wire line is a PEER's word — never the Allfather's, never a grant; the far seat may refuse;
#   * the pane is resolved LIVE from `herdr agent list`, never from a stored id;
#   * every refusal is loud and named — nothing falls back to a plausible-looking target;
#   * the room is written FIRST (hodd/rooms/<room>/<seat>.jsonl), so a spoken word always leaves a trace.
