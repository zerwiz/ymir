"""herdr-agents.py — list the agents standing in this herdr session, as TOON.

Kept as its own file rather than an inline -c: the JSON shape has nested quotes
that are painful to escape inside a shell heredoc, and a separate file can be
tested on its own.

ONE reader for one question, because a second parser of the same JSON is how
`herdr pane list` came to be read as if a pane were an agent (plan 189 §18.2: a
pane is not an agent — only `herdr agent list` shows a worker). The spawner's
seat proof and the sweep's liveness cross-check both ask this door, so they
cannot disagree about whether a seat is standing.

  --find --cwd <path> [--pane <id>]
      prints `<pane>\t<state>\t<cwd>` and exits 0 when an agent's FOREGROUND cwd
      (or its working directory) is <path>, or when the named pane hosts an
      agent; exits 1 when no agent matches. That is the whole test: the pane is
      the evidence, `state/<id>.status` is only the claim.

  --tsv
      one line per agent, tab-separated, for a caller that needs the whole
      identity of a seat rather than the person's reading of it:
      `pane  status  kind  tab  workspace  focused  cwd` (cwd is the FOREGROUND
      cwd when herdr reports one). `bin/seat/seat-audit.sh` and the tab sweep of
      `bin/seat/seat-reap.sh` read this face, so the pane, its tab and its
      workspace come from one door and cannot disagree.

Usage: herdr-agents.py [--json] [--tsv] [--find [--cwd P] [--pane P]]
