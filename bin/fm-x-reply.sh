# Post firstmate's composed answer back to the relay for a pending X-mode mention.
#
# Usage: fm-x-reply.sh <request_id> [--image <path>] <text>
#        fm-x-reply.sh <request_id> [--image <path>] --text-file <path>
#        fm-x-reply.sh <request_id> [--image <path>] -
#        fm-x-reply.sh <request_id> --followup [--image <path>] ...
#        fm-x-reply.sh <request_id> ... --receipt-file <path>
#
# --receipt-file <path> writes {request_id, endpoint, chunks, dry_run} to <path>
# after the reply lands, so a caller that must record HOW MANY messages were
# posted (bin/fm-public-followup.sh, building a typed delivery receipt) does not
# have to re-derive the split. Omitted by default and never written on failure,
# so stdout, exit codes, and every existing caller stay unchanged.
#
# The --text-file / stdin forms exist so a caller never has to inline reply text
# (which may be influenced by a public mention) into a shell command, where shell
# expansion or quote-breakage could bite. fmx-respond uses them; the positional
# <text> form is kept for back-compat and tests.
#
# Optional --image <path> attaches one local image file to the answer or followup
# POST body as {media_type,data_base64}. Supported extension mapping includes
# PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, and TIFF. If long text becomes a thread, the relay
# attaches that image to the first/opener message only.
#
# Two endpoints, one client. By default the reply is the single answer to a
# mention, POSTed to $RELAY/connector/answer. With --followup it is instead one
# of up to three later "here's where things stand" replies for a mention that
# spawned real work, POSTed to $RELAY/connector/followup; the relay retains the
# request binding for a 7-day window after the initial answer and accepts up to
# three thread-bound follow-ups against it. --followup may appear
# anywhere after the request_id; everything else (thread-split, payload shape,
# dry-run, never-inline safety) is identical, so only the endpoint and the
# dry-run marker differ.
#
# POSTs to $RELAY/connector/<answer|followup> with the bearer token. The relay
# binds the reply to the exact post it recorded for that request_id, so this
# client only ever echoes the relay-issued request_id and NEVER names a platform
# message id.
# On success it echoes ONLY that request_id; on a non-2xx (or transport failure)
# it exits non-zero so the caller knows the post did not land. The confirmed
# relay contract for an exhausted follow-up binding is HTTP 409 from
# /connector/followup, optionally with {"error":"followup_unavailable"} in the
# response body. This client always maps a follow-up 409 to exit code 9 so
# fm-x-followup.sh can tell "exhausted binding" apart from a transient post
# failure worth retrying; the body marker only sharpens the diagnostic. That
# relay-side 409 is secondary: after the relay's own cleanup sweep, a very-late
# call can instead see a benign no-op 200, so fm-x-followup.sh's local
# window/cap pruning remains the primary guard.
#
# Reply platform + split budget are resolved per axis: an explicit
# FMX_REPLY_PLATFORM / FMX_REPLY_MAX_CHARS env override wins (fm-x-followup passes
# recorded task-link context this way); otherwise resolution runs the durable
# per-request context registry -> the still-present inbox payload -> an
# authoritative relay lookup by request_id (fm-x-lib.sh:fmx_resolve_reply_context).
# The relay step is confined to a live follow-up so the answer path and every
# dry-run stay network-free. This is what keeps a delayed request-id follow-up on
# the ORIGINAL platform's budget even after the inbox is drained and with no task
# link surviving. FAIL-SAFE: if a --followup reply's platform/budget cannot be
# authoritatively resolved, this REFUSES with exit 8 (distinct from the 409 exit
# 9) rather than posting with a locally defaulted budget - firstmate holds and
# retries it.
#
# Long replies auto-split into a numbered thread. X stays within
# FMX_X_REPLY_MAX_CHARS, default 280. Discord uses
# FMX_DISCORD_REPLY_MAX_CHARS, default 1900, safely below Discord's 2000
# character message limit. A reply that fits in one message sends
# {request_id, text}; a thread sends {request_id, text, texts:[chunk,...]} where
# `texts` is the ordered "(k/n)" chunks for the relay to post as chained replies,
# and `text` is the first chunk so a relay that only reads `text` still posts the
# opener. If --image is present, the relay attaches it to this opener. At most
# FMX_X_THREAD_MAX messages (default 25) are produced.
#
# Live post config (home .env, FMX_ENV_FILE, or env): FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN
# (required), FMX_RELAY_URL (default https://myfirstmate.io). Auth:
# Authorization: Bearer <token>.
#
# Preview / dry-run: with FMX_DRY_RUN set (truthy), the reply is NOT posted.
# Instead the would-be POST body ({request_id, text}, or {request_id, text,
# texts} for a thread) is recorded to state/x-outbox/<request_id>.json and a "DRY
# RUN" summary is printed to stderr; stdout still echoes the request_id and the
# exit is 0, so the loop runs end to end without a public post. A follow-up
# dry-run additionally carries an "endpoint":"followup" marker in the recorded
# body so a preview is self-describing; the live POST body is unchanged. With
# --image, the dry-run record replaces image bytes with a compact image marker
# {media_type,bytes,source_path}, not the base64 bytes. Dry-run needs neither a
# token nor the relay.
