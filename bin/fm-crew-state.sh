#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-crew-state.sh - deterministic read of a crew's CURRENT state.
#
# Why this exists: state/<id>.status is an append-only, best-effort EVENT LOG.
# Crews append only wake-worthy transitions (done/needs-decision/blocked/paused/failed)
# and nothing when they silently resume, so `tail -1` of that log reports the
# last EVENT, not the current STATE. After firstmate resolves a needs-decision
# or blocked and the crew resumes (responds to the gate, the pipeline fixes, it
# re-validates), the log's last line stays stale. This helper never infers the
# current state from a tail of the log: it reads the authoritative source (a
# no-mistakes run-step attributed under bin/fm-nm-run-lib.sh's contract, else
# the pane busy-signature) and reconciles the possibly-stale log against it.
#
# The determinism lives entirely here - only run-step / pane / log reads plus
# fixed mapping logic, no heuristics and no LLM. Output is one stable, parseable,
# token-tight line firstmate can read every heartbeat:
#
#   state: <working|parked|done|blocked|paused|failed|unknown> · source: <run-step|pane|status-log|remote-endpoint|none> · <detail>
#
# Logic, in order:
#   1. Resolve worktree + backend target + kind from state/<id>.meta. A meta
#      recording remote_host= is a remote secondmate: its worktree and endpoint
#      live on that host, so the local worktree and pane reads are skipped and
#      the remote host is asked for the endpoint's recovery-grade state
#      (fm-on.sh + fm-remote-secondmate-control.sh state). alive falls through
#      to the routed status log; dead/missing report the remote verdict; an
#      unreachable or unreadable remote reports unknown-remote, never a false
#      gone/dead.
#   2. Attribute an active or terminal no-mistakes run under the branch, head,
#      pipeline-custody, and newest-first rules owned by bin/fm-nm-run-lib.sh.
#      The run-step is AUTHORITATIVE: running/fixing -> working, ci -> working,
#      awaiting_approval/fix_review -> parked (with gate findings), terminal
#      passed/checks-passed -> done, failed/cancelled -> failed. EXCEPT: while
#      the active step is ci, `axi status` alone cannot tell "still waiting on
#      checks" from "checks green, waiting on merge" (see nm_ci_checks_state) -
#      a ci-step log-tail check overrides working -> done once checks read
#      green, so a green PR is never silently read as still-validating.
#   3. Reconcile the status log: if its last line says needs-decision/blocked but
#      the run-step shows the run moved on, the log is deterministically stale and
#      is flagged superseded. A genuinely parked run plus a needs-decision log
#      agree, and are reported as parked.
#   4. No run for this crew (pre-validation, or kind=scout): fall back to the
#      recorded backend's pane busy state, then the status log's last line only
#      when its verb maps to a recognized run-state. Decision-only events such as
#      `resolved` never become current state or detail.
#   5. Missing meta or torn-down worktree: report unknown · none. If no run is
#      attributed to this crew, a dead endpoint also reports unknown · none rather
#      than trusting a stale status log.
#
# Read-only and side-effect free. Always exits 0 on a successful read regardless
# of state; exit 2 only on a usage error (no id).

# Coarse fallback for cross-branch attribution. `no-mistakes axi status` (bare)
# reports the active-or-most-recent run for the CURRENT branch when one
# exists, else falls back to some other branch's run purely as informational
# display (verified empirically: querying a worktree with its own active run
# reliably returns that run, even under concurrent load from several other
# validating crews on the same underlying repo). A crew whose branch genuinely
# has no run yet therefore sees another branch's answer here.
#
# This fallback used to shell out to `no-mistakes axi` (bare, no subcommand)
# expecting a `runs[N]{id,branch,status,...}:` TOON table and re-query the
# matched id via `axi status --run <id>`. Verified against the real installed
# CLI (v1.32.2): the `axi` surface exposes only abort/logs/respond/run/status -
# there is no runs-listing subcommand under `axi` at all, so that table never
# appears and the lookup was silently dead code; whenever the bare `axi
# status` answer was not this crew's own branch, attribution always failed and
# the caller fell straight through to the pane/log fallback below. (The
# PRIMARY cause of the 2026-07 herdr false-surface incidents turned out to be
# a separate bug in bin/fm-watch.sh's stale_is_terminal precedence - see that
# file's history - but this cross-branch path was independently confirmed
# dead code and is worth having actually work.)
#
# The real run-listing command is the top-level `no-mistakes runs` (verified:
# `no-mistakes --help` lists it separately from `axi`). It is plain, human-
# oriented text - no run id, no JSON/TOON, newest-first, columns
# "<status> <branch> <short-sha> <date> [<pr-url>]" separated by runs of
# spaces (verified: no quoting, so splitting on the first two whitespace runs
# is exact) - but branch + coarse status is exactly what this predicate needs:
# is a run for THIS branch active right now. Echoes the first (most recent)
