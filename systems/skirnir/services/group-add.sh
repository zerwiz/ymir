# group-add.sh — put Skírnir in a Telegram group, in one word.
#
#   group-add.sh                  # every group he has seen, and whether he answers there
#   group-add.sh allow <name|id>  # allow it: he answers there WHEN NAMED (never every message)
#   group-add.sh close <name|id>  # stop answering there at all (he is removed from the allowlist)
#
# THE LAW (the Allfather's word, 2026-10-23): "only my private chat should be answering on all.
# groups never." `allow` therefore grants the ROOM, never the loudness — there is no switch that makes
# him answer every message in a group, and this door no longer writes one.
#
# WHY: adding him used to mean reading a chat id out of a journal and editing YAML. A bot cannot join a
# group from an invite link — Telegram has no such API — so the human adds the bot once, he RECORDS the
# group (that is what `seen-groups.json` is for), and this door is the one word that follows.
