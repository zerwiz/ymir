# `hodd/state/` is gitignored, so `assistant.db` — every question anyone asked him, every refusal,
# every answer — is the ONE artifact in this house that dies with the hardware (measured 2026-10-22:
# 372 turns in a day, no copy anywhere). This snapshots the ledger and its policy files into
# `hodd/saves/assistant/<date>/`, which IS tracked, and prunes old snapshots.
#
# `--commit` stages and commits the newest snapshot in the home repo; `--push` also pushes it, so the
# fleet gets the ledger on its next pull. The Allfather's word (2026-10-22): "yes and on pushes" — the
# nightly row runs `--keep 7 --push`, and the home repo carries a `pre-push` hook that snapshots on
# every push as a safety net (a hook commit lands on the NEXT push; run `--commit` first to ride the
# same one).
