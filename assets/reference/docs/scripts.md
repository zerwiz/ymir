# The bin/ toolbelt

The first mate drives these; interactive entrypoints work by hand too, while `*-lib.sh` files are sourced helpers.
Each row is one purpose clause only: the script's own header comment is the authoritative description of its behavior, flags, and contracts, so read the header before first use.
If you have changed away from the firstmate home in an interactive shell, invoke these scripts by absolute path through the repo's `bin/` directory; the scripts self-locate internally after they start.
The shared no-mistakes gate refusal for fleet lifecycle entrypoints is summarized in [architecture.md](architecture.md#no-mistakes-gate-authority-boundary), while `docs/sessionstart-nudge.md` covers the silent session-open hook use; `fm-gate-refuse-lib.sh`'s header owns its exact contract.
