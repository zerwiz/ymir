# RULES — the house law

Numbered, binding rules for how Ymir is organised. A rule is law: code, plans,
UI, and agents obey it, and a change that contradicts a rule must first change
the rule (append-only; never silently rewritten).

```
rules_index[35]{file,subject}:
  "01-domains.md","domains (Greinar) · houses · Eindri"
  "02-agents.md","agents: home, kinds, profile contract, no mock"
  "03-houses.md","houses = companies; ownership, records, boundaries"
  "04-hoard.md","Hodd: the one private place — secrets, docs, tenants, identity"
  "05-platforms.md","one portable core + per-OS installation layers; core changes propagate"
  "06-append-only.md","some records are memory: append, never rewrite, never lose on a move"
  "07-config.md","configuration is never hardcoded: ports/hosts/paths/credentials resolve from env/config"
  "08-delivery-gate.md","PR-only delivery; treehouse worktrees; sandcastle sandboxes"
  "10-deployed-servers.md","every server/tool the runtime runs lives in the repo and is deployed from it"
  "14-features.md","every feature explained: FEATURES.md (the catalogue) + docs/features/ (the how-tos)"
  "15-vault-confidential.md","the vault is a confidential domain: NDA content never leaves it, in any form"
  "16-confidential-session.md","work on the vault with no route off it: confined workdir, doors off, model tier, airlock"
  "17-no-dead-code.md","no dead code: a file, function, branch or constant nothing reaches is a claim that a feature exists"
  "18-distinct-gates.md","distinct gates: one class per service, one gate per class — public · team · client · operator · confidential · fleet"
  "19-two-planes.md","two planes: OUR functions (the well, Runes, plans, the vault, the agents) and THE TEAM'S (places, the suite) — never blurred"
  "20-the-well-appends.md","the well appends: an episode is never replaced, rebuilt-over or lost to a restore; the count never falls"
  "21-company-documents.md","a company document is written in business language: no internal names, no persona, no infrastructure detail, no third party the reader need not know"
  "22-home-layout.md","the home has a layout: one resolver, one purpose per shelf, state only in the home, a company document only in a company or project shelf, discovery by registry, creation refused elsewhere, one name one meaning"
  "23-no-code-in-app-folders.md","an application lives in apps/; bin/ holds function-named machine tools — never an application's name in a path"
  "24-the-ward.md","a door is named or it is closed: nothing public without a credential, keys not passwords, the audit is a cron"
  "25-agnostic-by-construction.md","one core, every device: three axes, probe never assume, a clean skip is a pass, a move is a migration"
  "28-streaming-voice.md","Skírnir speaks in real time or not at all: a pipeline of overlapping stages, latency measured per turn, and a silent failure is a violation"
  "26-external-surfaces.md","private structure and NDA material never cross an external surface: no paths, vault names, secrets or classified material in Trello, email, Chat or a public PR"
  "29-the-apps-stay-whole.md","an update that leaves an app unreadable is not an update: every server entry parses, every route the UI calls is answered, and a raised gate answers no 5xx"
  "38-the-answer.md","an answer to the Allfather is prose, not a datasheet: short paragraphs, facts inside the sentence, and on Telegram a decision is a button"
  "README.md","this index"
  "37-a-surface-may-not-show-what-it-did-not-receive.md","a surface may not show what it did not receive"
```

Keep each rule short and unambiguous; reference it from code where it bites.

| 09 | `09-electron.md` | Electron is a local seat: local connections only, no login, the rune icon and entry installed, one lifecycle with the web. |
| 11 | `11-never-delete-only-move.md` | **Never delete, only move.** A file that is retired goes to `hodd/reference/` with why it went and what replaced it; the record keeps it. Enforced by `bin/no-delete-guard.sh`. |
| 12 | `12-bin-structure.md` | The shape of `bin/`: a layer per directory, a function per file; a script that is reached from nowhere is not a tool. |
| 10 | `10-deployed-servers.md` | Every server/service/worker/MCP runs from a file the repo owns and is deployed from it (`bin/fleet/fleet-ensure.sh`); never hand-placed on a machine. |
| 13 | `13-pi-extensions.md` | Pi extensions: **one home per extension** (`.pi/shared/extensions/` → `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`), pi's own layout (a directory needs `index.ts`), and `bin/seat/valknut-load.sh --check` as the gate. Two load paths means **no agent can be seated**. |
| 14 | `14-features.md` | Every feature is explained: `FEATURES.md` (the append-only master catalogue) + `docs/features/` (one plain-language how-to per user-facing feature), enforced by `bin/gates/guards/features-guard.sh`. |
| 18 | `18-distinct-gates.md` | Distinct gates: **one class per service, one gate per class**. public · team · client · operator · confidential (the vault) · fleet (agents). A door never serves two classes, and the refusal is the feature. |
| 19 | `19-two-planes.md` | **Two planes:** OURS (the operator + fleet — the well, Runes, plans, the vault, the agents) and **THE TEAM'S** (places, the suite, their chat/files/record). A function belongs to one plane; **there is no team well**. |
| 20 | `20-the-well-appends.md` | **The well appends:** an episode is written once and stays. A fork is a UNION, a repair ADDS, and the episode count and the log's lines never fall — enforced by `bin/records/well-guard.sh` (the `well` surface of Eir). |
| 21 | `21-company-documents.md` | **Company documents are written in business language.** Plain professional English; no internal names, no persona or allegory, no infrastructure detail, no third party the reader need not know. A document that cannot be written without internal terms is an **internal** document. |
| 22 | `22-home-layout.md` | **The home has a layout, and nothing is created outside it.** One resolver; one purpose per shelf; state in `$YMIR_HOME/state` and nowhere else; a company document in a company or project shelf, never in the operator's own; discovery by registry, never by walking the tree; creation refused elsewhere; one name, one meaning. |
| 23 | `23-no-code-in-app-folders.md` | **An application lives in `apps/`.** `bin/` holds the machine's tools, named for the LAYER and then the FUNCTION; no directory under `bin/` may be named after an app, and an app-named file there must carry a function (`<app>-ensure.sh`). Enforced by `bin/gates/guards/app-folder-guard.sh`. |
| 24 | `24-the-ward.md` | **The ward:** a non-loopback socket is named or closed; anything public authenticates or does not exist; ssh is keys-only on the LAN and the tailnet; the audit is a cron; secrets at rest are 0600; a mend that could lock the operator out is his to make. Enforced by `bin/ward/{security-audit,verdr,harden}.sh` and Eir's `ward` surface. *(23 is held by the app-folders rule in flight.)* |
| 25 | `25-agnostic-by-construction.md` | **One core, every device.** Three axes (device · hardware · OS); capability is PROBED, never assumed; a layer that does not apply reports SKIP and exits 0; a core change ships its layer change in the same commit; **a move is a migration** — the new path, a migration that heals existing homes, and a ward that would have caught it (`.agents/paths-ledger.yaml` + `bin/gates/guards/path-ledger-guard.sh`). |

| 15 | `15-vault-confidential.md` | The vault is a **confidential domain**: content under NDA never leaves it, in any form, local or remote; no model, log, embedding, ticket, or network ever sees it; enforced by `bin/gates/guards/vault-guard.sh`. |
| 16 | `16-confidential-session.md` | A **confidential session** (`bin/vault/confidential.sh`): work on the vault with no route off it — confined workdir, off-vault doors off, an explicit model tier (local/none/remote), and `--airlock` for no network at all; `confidential-guard` refuses out-of-vault commits. |
| 17 | `17-no-dead-code.md` | **No dead code**: an unreached file, function, branch or constant reads as a working feature and is not one; enforced by `bin/gates/guards/dead-code-guard.sh`. |
| 26 | `26-external-surfaces.md` | **Private data does not cross an external surface.** No vault path, vault filename, secret or NDA/classified material in a Trello card, email, Chat or public PR; enforced by `bin/gates/guards/private-guard.sh` in mail and Trello. |

## Appended 2026-10-21 — the documents are checked

| 27 | [The documents are checked, not trusted](27-the-documents-are-checked.md) | a user-facing document's paths, packages and ports are verified by a ward, and a stale instruction fails the push |

## Appended 2026-10-22 — the voice is streaming, or it is not a voice

| # | Rule | In one line |
|---|---|---|
| 28 | [Streaming voice](28-streaming-voice.md) | **Skírnir speaks in real time or he does not speak.** Capture is continuous, ASR is incremental over a rolling window, endpointing is a short VAD hangover, the answer is token-streamed and cut into sentences, the first sentence is synthesised immediately, and audio is pushed in real-time frames. Long text is allowed; a long silence is not. Every turn logs `stt_ms`, `ttft_ms`, `first_audio_ms`, `turn_ms` (target: first audio ≤ 1.5 s), and a **silent failure — a dead synthesiser, a full GPU, an empty buffer — is a violation**, not a soft error. Two gates stand before any claim: the bench oracle (push → record back → transcribe → match) and the room's own recording. |
| 30 | [Audio is ephemeral](30-audio-is-ephemeral.md) | **A recording is a means, not a record.** The transcript and the minutes are the record; audio may be deleted only after a transcript exists (or on an explicit `--force`, which writes a Rune). Audio has a 24-hour clock, the shelves have caps and the OLDEST goes first, and the tiers are hot (this machine, Opus 24 kbit/s mono), cold (one of the operator's drives, filed by month) and far (whynot's disks). Text stays forever. |

## Appended 2026-10-22 — an update that leaves an app unreadable is not an update

| # | Rule | In one line |
|---|---|---|
| 29 | [The apps stay whole](29-the-apps-stay-whole.md) | **Every change that ships leaves every app able to start and every panel able to speak to it.** Three duties, one ward (`bin/gates/guards/app-functional-guard.sh`, wired into `bin/gates/guards.sh`): **it parses** (every app server entry is transpiled before it ships), **every door the UI knocks on is answered** (a route the interface calls and the server never implements is a promise the product does not keep), and **with the app raised, nothing answers 5xx** (`--live`). It exists because one missing `return {` took Hlidskjalf's whole data face down for a day — every `/api/*` 500 with zero bytes, the well reading DOWN over a healthy bridge — and no gate noticed. |
| 37 | [A surface may not show what it did not receive](37-a-surface-may-not-show-what-it-did-not-receive.md) | **A panel, a letter, a report or a file that Smíðja or Snotra puts before a person may not present a value it did not actually receive.** A refused read is not zero; a failed probe is not "down"; an unknown attribution is not a name; an empty file is not a transcript. Measured six times in one evening: the Snotra panel showed 0 meetings on a **401** while 24 decisions sat on the shelf; the Well tile said "bridge down" while `:4602/health` answered 200; Nornir said STOPPED while the runner held 29 jobs; Mánagandr said "the window is empty" over a failed read; `speakers` wrote three WAVs of static and exited 0; a letter invented a policy and a date its own record contradicted. It is the *surface* half of Rule 25: **no figure without a receipt, no diagnosis from an absence, and a generator proves its output or refuses it.** |

## Appended 2026-10-23 — the answer is prose, and a decision is a button

| # | Rule | In one line |
|---|---|---|
| 38 | [The answer is prose, and a decision is a button](38-the-answer.md) | **An answer to the Allfather is written to be read, not parsed.** Short paragraphs, one idea each, facts quoted inside the sentence. TOON blocks, code fences, column tables and runs of bolded datum belong in files and agent-facing output — never in his reading. On **Telegram**, a decision gets **2–6 buttons** (`telegram_button`, `emoji + text`, a self-contained prompt each) instead of "reply 1 or 2"; a click is an ordinary request, never a grant of authority. |
  "34-the-record-has-a-shape.md","a record has a shape: the header contract, a verified that is a command, views rendered not appended, reproducible and gated, a gate on the diff, correction by citation"
  "35-the-research-is-kept.md","what was learned outside is kept: one episode per question, in our words, with its sources and its route, indexed by date in the home; an unsourced finding is an opinion"
## Appended 2026-10-23 — a record has a shape, and what was learned outside is kept
| 34 | [A record has a shape](34-the-record-has-a-shape.md) | **A document meant to be found again carries the header, and a view is rendered.** One contract — the one the harness already enforces, extended with `owner · tags · sources`; a **typed** document is `---` with `kind` and `status`; `verified:` is a **command** a reader can re-run; every index (`FEATURES.md`, `RULES/README.md`, `*/DOORS.md`, the library's `INDEX.md`) is **derived**, and a derived view that is not **reproducible and gated** is a document pretending to be a register; the gate is on the **diff**, not on history; a correction is a new record citing the old one. |
| 35 | [What was learned outside is kept](35-the-research-is-kept.md) | **Every research episode is kept, in the home, by date, with its sources and its route.** One question, the finding **in our words**, every page behind it, under `hodd/library/research/<YYYY>/<MM>/`, indexed from the folders; **an unsourced finding is an opinion** (only a recorded **negative result** may stand without a source); an episode is never rewritten; nothing private enters the library (Rule 15 wins). |
  "36-the-run-is-visible.md","the run is visible or it did not happen: the trace is the record, one writer and one DB, the team from the roster YAML, uv from the repo root, pi -ne in a worktree, a failure shows its cause"
## Appended 2026-10-23 — the run is visible, or it did not happen
| 36 | [The run is visible](36-the-run-is-visible.md) | **Every agent run appears in the Smíðja — session, phases, the agent lane, events and a verdict — and the trace is the record.** One writer and one database (`$YMIR_HOME/smidja/smidja.db`); the team comes from the roster YAML; the invocation is `uv run apps/smidja/smidja_*.py` **from the repo root**; `pi` starts with `-ne` in a worktree and its declared extensions are added with `-e`; a failure shows its cause in the panel; and **nobody patches the screen with a hand-written row**. |
  "09-electron.md","Rule 09 — Electron is a Local Seat"
  "11-never-delete-only-move.md","Rule 11 — Never delete, only move"
  "12-bin-structure.md","Rule 12 — `bin/` has a shape: one folder per system, and nothing loose"
  "13-pi-extensions.md","Rule 13 — Pi extensions: one home, pi's own layout, and a gate that proves it"
  "27-the-documents-are-checked.md","27 — The documents are checked, not trusted"
  "30-audio-is-ephemeral.md","30 — Audio is ephemeral: it exists only to become text"
