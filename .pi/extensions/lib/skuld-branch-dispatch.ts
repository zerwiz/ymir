// reads `accepted`: true means the branch now owns delivering and handling the
// wake (including its own fallback back to main on a later failure); false
// means no branch took it and the watcher delivers to main exactly as it did
// before the branch existed. Watcher-failure alarms are never offered - only
// main can repair the watcher cycle (brokk_watch_arm_pi lives on main).

// A check-kind row - merge-confirmation polls, Relay mentions, credential/auth
// failures, and every other legitimately main-only class - never vetoes a scan
// in either mode. It is simply excluded from eligibleSeqs and left queued for
// main, which is woken for it on that check's own watcher cycle
// (brokk-primary-pi-watch.ts forces every check-kind TRIGGER to main), so nothing

// heartbeat used to be deferred to main merely because some unrelated check
// row happened to be sitting unread, which put a routine fleet review in the
// Allfather's chat for a reason that had nothing to do with the fleet. A
// permanently main-owned row is not fleet context the branch is missing, so it
// no longer rides the heartbeat into main (docs/pi-supervision-branch.md
// "Heartbeat routing").
//
// The heartbeat's all-or-nothing contract is unchanged in what it actually
// guarantees: a heartbeat review takes EVERY branch-ownable unread row or none
// of them. An unresolvable signal/stale row (unmapped project) still vetoes the
// whole scan in both modes, because that is a data/metadata problem this
// function cannot safely reason past, not an ordinary main-only event. A row
// this repo's brokk_wake_append could never have produced (an unknown kind, or a
// line that fails the structural tab-field check) also still vetoes the whole
// scan - that is queue corruption, not an everyday mixed queue.
