---

Give a bot a job, connect the apps it needs, and follow its work in chat. Each bot has a name, a look, its own memory, and a screen you can watch or take over. Bots can message each other, run recurring tasks, and talk with you over voice.

The interface is modeled on Grok Bot. Underneath, every bot is a Hermes agent, so it can run on the model subscriptions you already pay for (Claude, ChatGPT, Grok and others) or on API keys.

## What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| **Chat that shows the work** | While a bot works you see what it is doing right now, how long it has been at it, and each step it took. Finished turns fold into a "Worked for 2m 10s · 7 steps" chip you can open. |
| **A screen per bot** | Every bot has its own desktop on the shared computer. Watch it live in the side panel, open it full size, or take control with your own mouse and keyboard. |
| **Your existing Hermes agent, kept as it is** | The first bot is the Hermes agent already running on the computer. Its messaging channels, skills and memory keep working; the app only calls its API. |
| **Connected apps with approvals** | Bots ask for the app they need and you connect it through Composio. Actions that write (send, post, delete) wait for your OK on a card in the chat. |
| **Model and subscription per bot** | Pick the provider and model in the bot's Engine panel, or sign in to a subscription on the bot's own screen. |
| **Voice** | Talk to a bot with xAI's realtime voice modes. Real work is handed to the same bot, with the same memory and tools. |
| **Research on X** | Every bot has an `x_search` tool, backed by xAI. |
| **Routines, tasks and a Library** | Recurring jobs on a schedule, a task list per bot, and a place where bots save the files they make. |

## How it fits together

```

- **One computer, one screen per bot.** All bots live on a single Orgo Linux computer. The first bot uses the computer's main screen; each further bot gets an Orgo screen of its own. Orgo allows four screens per computer, so four bots.
- **The first bot is the Hermes agent that already runs on that computer.** The app talks to its gateway and never restarts it or rewrites its settings.
- **Every other bot gets its own Hermes home and gateway**, started by the app. Each has its own model, sign-in, memory, browser profile and files.
- **The app's tools reach Hermes over MCP.** The server exposes `/mcp/<bot>`. Each agent gets connected apps, `x_search`, tasks, routines, the Library, and messages to other bots.
- **Screens are dressed to look like the bot's own computer**: a light desktop with a dock, and a home screen with the bot's name and apps as Chrome's new tab page.

More detail is in the [architecture guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### How this relates to Hermes Bot Mode

Hermes Desktop has its own Bot Mode. Bot HQ uses the same Hermes engine but does **not** use Bot Mode: it has its own bot layer on top of the gateway's HTTP API.

| | Bot HQ | Hermes Bot Mode |
|---|---|---|
| A bot is | A separate Hermes home (the first bot is the default profile) | A Hermes profile |
| Gateways | One per extra bot | One, serving every profile |
| Transport | HTTP, `/v1/responses` | JSON-RPC over WebSocket |
| Routines | The app's own scheduler | Hermes cron jobs |
| Bot to bot | The app's `send_to_bot` tool | Hermes' `message_agent` tool |

So bots made here do not show up in Hermes Desktop's Bots tab, and bots made there do not show up here.

## Install on the computer

The app is meant to run on the same Orgo computer as Hermes.

1. On your machine: `npm ci && scripts/pack.sh hq-app.tgz`. Copy `hq-app.tgz` and `scripts/install-on-computer.sh` to the computer.
2. In Orgo, create a public URL for port `8787` on that computer.
3. On the computer, as root:

   ```bash
   PUBLIC_URL=https://<name>.orgo.dev ORGO_COMPUTER_ID=<uuid> ALLOWED_EMAILS=you@example.com \
   KEYS_FILE=/root/keys.txt PRIMARY_CDP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9333 \
     bash install-on-computer.sh hq-app.tgz
   ```

   `KEYS_FILE` holds `XAI_API_KEY=` and `COMPOSIO_API_KEY=` lines (and `ORGO_API_KEY=` if Hermes' own `.env` has none); it is deleted after the first install. `PRIMARY_CDP_URL` is only for a main agent that already has its own Chrome. The script installs to `/opt/hq`, adds one supervisor program (`hq-app`), and leaves Hermes alone. Running it again with a newer `hq-app.tgz` upgrades the app and keeps its settings and data.
4. Give the main agent the app's tools: `python3 /opt/hq/app/scripts/add-hq-to-hermes.py`. It adds one `mcp_servers.hq` entry to Hermes' `config.yaml`, keeps a dated copy of the file, and Hermes picks the change up without a restart. `--remove` takes it out again.
5. Open the public URL and sign in with Google. If Google sign-in is not set up yet, `bash /opt/hq/app/scripts/sign-in-link.sh you@example.com` on the computer prints a one-time sign-in link.

<details>
<summary><b>Remove everything</b></summary>

On the computer:

```bash
python3 /opt/hq/hq-screen.py undress 99                      # main screen back to how it was (99 = its X display)
python3 /opt/hq/app/scripts/add-hq-to-hermes.py --remove     # take the tools out of Hermes
supervisorctl stop hq-app && supervisorctl remove hq-app
rm -rf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/hq-app.conf /opt/hq /var/log/hq /root/grokbot /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/hq.json
```

Then delete the public URL in Orgo. Screens of the other bots are released when you delete those bots in the app.

</details>

## Run it locally

You need **Node.js 22 or newer** and a Hermes gateway with its API server on (`API_SERVER_KEY` in `~/.hermes/.env`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nickvasilescu/bot-hq.git
cd bot-hq
npm ci
cp .env.example .env      # fill in the keys; comments in the file explain each one
npm run dev -w server     # API on :8787
npm run dev -w web        # app on :5173
```

With `HQ_LOCAL=0` the server reaches the computer through the Orgo API instead of running commands on it, which is enough for development. `DEV_LOGIN=1` enables the email-only sign-in form; never set it on a public address.

`npm run build && npm start` serves the built app from the API port.

The keys you need:

| Key | Used for |
|---|---|
| `ORGO_API_KEY`, `ORGO_COMPUTER_ID` | The computer and its screens |
| `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` | Connected apps |
| `XAI_API_KEY` | Voice and `x_search` |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Sign-in sessions and the tokens agents use to reach `/mcp` |

## Models and subscriptions

Open a bot's details panel, **Engine**. Pick a provider and model there. **Sign in to a subscription** opens a terminal on the bot's screen running Hermes' own sign-in for that provider (for example Claude Pro/Max), so you finish it in the viewer and the bot uses that subscription from then on. Check your provider's terms before running an agent on a consumer subscription.

## Development

```bash
npm run typecheck       # server and web
npm run build
node tests/e2e.mjs https://<your-url>    # needs DEV_LOGIN=1, or E2E_SESSION=<session cookie>
```

The e2e suite creates a temporary bot (with its own Hermes gateway and screen), exercises chat, the browser on its screen, the live viewer, connected apps, voice sessions and settings, then deletes it. It calls real providers.

```text
server/src/         API, Hermes adapter (agent/loop.ts), engines (engine.ts), MCP endpoint (mcp.ts), screens (computer.ts)
server/box/         what runs on the computer to dress a screen (desktop, dock, home screen, Chrome)
web/src/            chat, bot settings, app connections, computer viewer, voice
scripts/            pack, install, Hermes config helper, sign-in link
tests/              Playwright end-to-end test
docs/               architecture; the Orgo and xAI/Composio guides predate the Hermes engine
```

## Status and limits

- Experimental, no security audit. Bots share one computer and can reach each other's files there.
- Approval cards cover Composio write actions. What a bot does through its browser or shell is not gated, and Hermes' own "risky command" prompts are not shown in the app yet.
- Four bots at most, because of Orgo's four-screen limit.
- The app still calls itself "Grokbot" in places (page title, package names, the database file).
- The screen look is an original implementation inspired by OrgoAI/bops; no code or assets from that repository are used.
