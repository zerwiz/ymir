# smidja Overview

The system map the orchestrator reads on startup — what smidja is, how a stamped repo is laid out, and which cookbook to load next.

## What smidja is

Smíðja builds repeatable **agents plus code** workflows. Deterministic Python (an smidja script) owns sequencing, retries, and acceptance; agents are bounded nodes inside that graph. Agent proposes, code disposes.

Your job as orchestrator: **run the system, observe the system, help the engineer interact with it.** You do not do the work an smidja exists to do.

```

**v1 runs Pi only.** `coding_agent: pi`, default model `gemini-3.6-flash`, thinking `medium`. `claude_code` is specced in the config and stubbed in the interface — it lands in v2.

## The phase model

Every smidja run is a sequence of **phases**, each one `with run.phase(PhaseParams(...))`. Three kinds, three swim lanes:

- **engineer** — the human lane; today the system-input phase (who asked, and for what).
- **agent** — `ph.call(AgentCall(...))`: prompt in → typed envelope out → gates verified.
- **code** — deterministic steps that stand alone (git branch, git commit, migrate). Never buried inside an agent phase.

**Success must be earned — every phase defaults to `fail`.** A clean exit flips it to success; agent phases additionally require the envelope to parse and all gates to come back green. A raise keeps it failed, records an error event, and aborts the run. `retries=N` on an agent phase buys extra gate-correction rounds through the same session before that raise happens.

## Envelopes

Agents have exactly two output channels: reference files written into `context_handoff/`, and a **final valid-JSON response** parsed against the output type the call declared. Code persists it as `envelope.json` and injects it into the next agent's `user.md` via `{{previous_envelope}}`. Bad JSON is never a restart — the harness re-prompts the *same session, context intact*, until it parses (bounded). See `references/handoff.md`.

**The output contract is a synced triad**: the type in `data_types.py` ↔ the `## Report` JSON example in the agent's `user.md` ↔ `output_type=` at the call site. Editing any one of the three means editing all three in the same change — drift between them taxes every call with correction retries.

## Running an smidja

```bash
uv run smidja/smidja_plan.py "add a /health endpoint"
uv run smidja/smidja_plan_build.py requests/health.md --smidja-id a1b2c3d4
```

The prompt is inline text or a file path. `--smidja-id` is optional on every smidja: given one, the run joins that session (same dirs, same `context_handoff/`, agents resume their existing context windows); omitted, a fresh id is minted and printed.

## When you have finished reading this

You are done with startup. List the smidja (`ls smidja/smidja_*.py`, plus each `Phases:` docstring line) as a table, and **wait for the engineer's request.**

Do not survey anything else — not the trace db, not the config, not past runs, not the repo tree. You do not yet know what the request is, so anything you gather now is a guess about what will matter, spent from the context the real work needs. Every cookbook and reference below is lazy-loaded, one per request, and that is the whole design.

## Where to go next

Load one cookbook per request — this overview is the only one you read up front.

| Request | Cookbook |
|---|---|
| Turn a request into the prompt an smidja gets | `how_to_prompt_for_the_eng.md` — **read before every launch** |
| Set the system up in a repo | `install.md` |
| Write a new smidja script | `create_adw.md` |
| Change an existing smidja chain | `update_adw.md` |
| Generate `smidja.config.yaml` | `create_config.md` |
| Add or retune an agent | `update_config.md` |
| Add low-level logic or a gate | `update_modules.md` |
| Run and monitor a workflow | `how_to_prompt_for_the_eng.md`, then `run_adw.md` |

References, loaded when you need the spec: `references/config.md` (full config schema), `references/handoff.md` (envelope + session layout), `references/observability.md` (events, db tables, polling).
