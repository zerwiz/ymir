/**
 * Routes Pi events from every workspace's PiRpcManager to the renderer.
 *
 * Non-dialog events keep the deliberate active-workspace-only filter: the
 * renderer's piStatus/stream state is a single global view and must track the
 * active workspace. Blocking extension-UI dialogs (select/confirm/input/editor)
 * are different — Pi holds the tool call until an answer arrives, with no
 * timeout on permission confirms — so dropping one from an inactive workspace
 * deadlocks that workspace's turn. The router instead:
 *
 *  - retains the one delivered dialog per workspace (renderer slot is
 *    reconstructible from main state at any moment via flush),
 *  - queues further dialogs per workspace and serializes delivery,
 *  - remembers each request's origin manager so the answer always reaches the
 *    Pi that asked, regardless of which workspace is active at answer time,
 *  - evicts a manager's held prompts when its process stops (a dead Pi can
 *    never consume an answer).
 *
 * Electron-free factory: all I/O goes through injected deps, so tests drive it
 * with bare emitters and an injected clock.
