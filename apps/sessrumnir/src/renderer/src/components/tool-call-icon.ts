// Icon that mirrors a tool call's operation (a fetch shows a globe, a read a
// document, etc.). Keyed off the same tool kind as toolCallLabel so icon and
// text stay in sync. Unknown tools fall back to the Terminal icon (same as
// run) — a custom tool is most often a command-style call, so the terminal
// reads sensibly as a generic op. Shared by the finalized message bubble (as
// a row avatar) and the streaming bubble (inline in the tool box).
