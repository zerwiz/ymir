# Contributing to Pi Desktop

This guide covers bug reports, feature requests, and the pull request workflow.

## Architecture reference: `AGENTS.md`

[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) is the canonical reference for the project's architecture, module layout, data-storage locations, distribution model, and delivery standards. Read it before making non-trivial changes; it is kept more current and more detailed than the summary in this guide.

### For AI coding agents

If you use an AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Kilo, Cursor, etc.) to work on this repository, the agent must read and follow [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), in particular its Final Delivery Checklist, before proposing or committing changes. Most agents load a file named `AGENTS.md` automatically; if yours does not, point it at the file explicitly at the start of a session.

At minimum, an agent's work must:

- Reuse existing patterns and utilities instead of duplicating logic
- Ship complete implementations (no placeholders, dead code, or deferred work)
- Add or update the colocated `*.test.ts` tests for any changed module
- Pass `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and `npx tsx --test`
- Preserve the Electron security posture (see Electron security below)

## Contributor License Agreement

**Before your first contribution can be merged, you must agree to the [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](CLA.md).**

The CLA confirms you have the right to contribute the code, grants the project a license to use your contribution, protects against patent claims, and defines trademark boundaries.

By submitting a pull request, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the CLA.

## How to contribute

### Reporting bugs

1. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/FaqFirebase/pi-desktop/issues) first
2. Open a new issue with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Environment (OS, Electron version, Pi version)
   - Screenshots if applicable

### Suggesting features

1. Open a [feature request](https://github.com/FaqFirebase/pi-desktop/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml)
2. Describe the use case and expected behavior
3. Explain why this would be useful to other users

### Submitting code

This repository uses two long-lived branches:

- `master` holds public-facing docs only (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `LICENSE`, `CLA.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.gitignore`). Do not target PRs here.
- `Dev` holds all application source and is where active development happens. **Target your pull requests against `Dev`.**

Steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Check out and branch from `Dev`:
   ```bash
   git checkout Dev
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```
3. Make your changes following the coding standards below
4. Test your changes thoroughly
5. Commit with a clear message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add my feature"
   ```
6. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```
7. Open a pull request against `Dev` (not `master`)

### Commit message format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types:

- `feat`: new feature
- `fix`: bug fix
- `docs`: documentation
- `style`: formatting (no code change)
- `refactor`: code restructuring (no behavior change)
- `test`: adding or updating tests
- `chore`: build process, dependencies, tooling
- `perf`: performance improvement

Examples:

```
feat(chat): add file attachment support

fix(pi-rpc): handle EPIPE errors gracefully

docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Coding standards

### TypeScript

- Full strict mode enabled
- No `any` types; use proper typing
- Named constants instead of magic numbers
- Async/await over callbacks
- Proper error handling (no empty catch blocks)

### React

- Functional components with hooks
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- No class components

### Electron security

- `contextIsolation: true`
- `nodeIntegration: false`
- All IPC through preload bridge
- Validate all IPC payloads
- No arbitrary command execution from renderer

### Code style

Conventions, not enforced by ESLint (the lint step checks the recommended rule sets, React hooks, unused vars, and semantic colors):

- 2-space indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons only when required
- Trailing commas in multi-line
- Max line length: 120 characters

## Translations

Interface text lives in `resources/locales/<code>/translation.json`. English (`en`) is the source.

To add a language:

1. Copy `resources/locales/en/translation.json` to `resources/locales/<code>/translation.json`. Use a BCP 47 code such as `de`, `pt-BR`, or `zh-Hans`.
2. Translate the values. Do not change keys, `{{placeholders}}`, `<tags>`, or the product names Pi Desktop, Pi, and OMP. Leave a value empty if you are not sure; the app shows English for it.
3. Set `language.nativeName` to the language's own name, for example `Deutsch`.
4. Add the file to `src/shared/i18n/resources.ts` (one import and one entry).
5. Run `npm run lint` and the unit tests, then open a pull request. The CLA applies to translations.

To try a language, pick it in Settings > Appearance > Language.

When you add interface text in code, use a key with `t()` and run `npx i18next-cli extract` to add the key to every language file. Then write the English text in `resources/locales/en/translation.json`.

To find text that is not translated, start the app with the test language enabled:

```bash
PI_DESKTOP_PSEUDO_LANGUAGE=1 npm run dev
```

Pick the bracketed entry (`[Éñĝļîšĥ ~~~]`) in Settings > Appearance > Language and save. Every translated string then shows accented letters inside brackets, longer than English. Plain English text on screen was not translated, unless it is data such as file names, model names, or chat content.

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. Type check passes:
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   ```

2. Lint passes:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

3. Unit tests pass:
   ```bash
   npx tsx --test
   ```

4. Build succeeds:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. App launches and works:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. No regressions in existing functionality
