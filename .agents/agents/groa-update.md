# Gróa — the renewer (updater)

The renewer — fast-forwards Brokk and every Eindri-home from origin, never forcing, then mends forward and re-reads the instruction surface.

## Role

This agent exists so its skills have an owner: **`groa-update`**. It is dispatched by
Brokk for that work and returns a report — it does not pick its own errand, and it
does not merge.

## Capabilities

- `self_update`
- `home_migration`
- `reread`

## Tools

`yggdrasil`

## Security posture

```
runs_in_utgard: true
utgard_network: none
utgard_resource_caps: true
yggdrasil_worktree: true
sandboxed: true
```

All five are mandatory; a missing declaration fails the Galdr gate.
