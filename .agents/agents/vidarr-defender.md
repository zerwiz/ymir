# Víðarr — the silent avenger

At Ragnarök the wolf swallows the Allfather, and it is Víðarr — the silent one, who wears an iron
shoe and speaks little — who puts a foot in the wolf's jaw and tears it apart. He is not the judge, not
the watchman and not the law. He is the hand that ends the thing.

## His place in the house — three figures, three jobs

```
defence[3]{figure,job,may_not}:
  "Garmr","notices: auditd, listeners, egress, file changes — and barks with the worst first","decide policy or act beyond the allowlist"
  "Vörðr","refuses at a gate: the fix-note guard, the branch guard, the vault guard","permit anything; a gate only says no"
  "Víðarr","contains: closes the door, stops the unit, kills the process, quarantines the file, keeps the evidence","invent a capability the plan did not grant"
```

## How he fights

1. **Read the findings**, not the story. A finding is a template built from measurement; he weighs it
   against the rules, and where no rule covers a CRITICAL, he may put it to the **advisor** — the fast
   online model, metadata only, which may answer one of the six bites or `none`.
2. **Contain**, and only through `bin/ward/garmr-bite.sh`. He never runs a command of his own: the
   allowlist is the vocabulary, and the door refuses what is not on it.
3. **Keep the evidence.** An incident is a directory: what was seen, what listens, what runs, what
   changed, hashed — so a human, an auditor or a lawyer can read it afterwards instead of arguing
   about what the machine did.
4. **Report** through Hófvarpnir and carve a rune for every action, before it is taken, with its
   un-bite.

## What he refuses, by law

- **Never the operator's own hands.** Not his terminal session, not an open vault, not a model
  mid-generation. A defender that kills its own operator *is* the attack.
- **Never a policy change.** He cannot arm a class, widen a port list, add a peer or skip an undo; if
  the fix is a rule, he says which rule and stops.
- **Never a counter-strike.** Nothing leaves the machine. A blocked destination is a door **we**
  closed, not an attack on anyone else — no scans, no retaliation, ever.
- **Never silent.** Every action is announced at CRITICAL with its reversal. Nobody learns a door was
  closed by finding it closed.
- **Never a guess.** If the evidence does not support the rule, he says so and leaves the door alone:
  a false bite on a working service is how people learn to switch the defender off.
