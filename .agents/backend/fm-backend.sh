# fm-backend.sh - runtime-backend selection, meta helpers, selector resolution,
# and dispatch for firstmate's session-provider abstraction.
#
# Design: data/fm-backend-design-d7/report.md ("Backend Interface") and
# data/fm-backend-design-d7/herdr-addendum.md ("Events as the core
# abstraction"). P1 extracted the tmux command sequences that fm-send.sh,
# fm-peek.sh, fm-watch.sh, fm-spawn.sh, and fm-teardown.sh already ran inline
# into bin/backends/tmux.sh, with those SAME command sequences, so the default
# (tmux) path stays byte-identical. P2 adds bin/backends/herdr.sh, an
# EXPERIMENTAL spawn-capable backend behind `--backend herdr`/`FM_BACKEND=herdr`/
# `config/backend`, and behind runtime auto-detection when firstmate itself is
# running inside herdr with no explicit backend setting; see herdr-addendum.md and
# data/fm-backend-design-d7/herdr-verification-p2.md for its empirical basis.
# P3 adds bin/backends/zellij.sh, also EXPERIMENTAL and spawn-capable, behind
# `--backend zellij`/`FM_BACKEND=zellij`/`config/backend` - NOT behind runtime
# auto-detection (report.md's Open Question #2: start with a dedicated
# background session for predictability, unlike tmux's/herdr's ambient-session
# reuse); see report.md's "Zellij Backend" section and docs/zellij-backend.md
# for its empirical basis. P4 makes Orca spawn-capable: Orca owns both the
# task worktree and the terminal endpoint. P5 adds bin/backends/cmux.sh, also
# EXPERIMENTAL and spawn-capable, behind `--backend cmux`/`FM_BACKEND=cmux`/
# `config/backend`, and behind runtime auto-detection when firstmate itself is
# running inside a cmux-spawned terminal (primary CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID marker, or
# the documented macOS fallback signals when cmux's claude wrapper strips that
# marker) with no explicit backend setting - unlike Orca, which stays
# never-auto-detected because it also owns the task worktree; see
# docs/cmux-backend.md for its empirical basis.
# Codex App is intentionally not in the known set yet.
# docs/codex-app-backend.md owns that blocked backend contract.
#
# Compatibility contract: a task's meta may omit `backend=`; every reader here
# treats that as `tmux` (fm_backend_of_meta), and fm-spawn.sh does not write
# `backend=tmux` for a default-backend task, so existing and newly spawned
# default-path metas stay byte-identical. Only a task spawned on a non-tmux
# spawn-capable backend, currently experimental herdr, zellij, orca, or cmux,
# carries an explicit `backend=` line.
#
# Event-source framing (herdr-addendum "Events as the core abstraction"): a
# backend's supervision surface is conceptually an EVENT SOURCE - it produces
# task events (status-changed, went-stale, exited) that map onto firstmate's
# existing signal/stale/check/heartbeat wake vocabulary. The tmux adapter has
# no native event push, so fm-watch.sh's poll loop over the pull primitives
# below (capture, list-live, busy-state via regex) IS the default event-source
# implementation that synthesizes those events; P1 only names that seam, it
# does not change the loop's behavior. The pull primitives also stay available
# on their own for on-demand reads (fm-peek.sh, fm-crew-state.sh).

# fm_backend_detect: detect the runtime firstmate itself is CURRENTLY executing

# env-marker detection layer for harnesses). Prints the detected backend name
# and returns 0, or returns 1 when nothing is detected. Nesting resolves
# INNERMOST-first: tmux sets $TMUX in every process running inside it, even a
# tmux started inside a herdr pane, so $TMUX is checked first and wins over
# HERDR_ENV=1 in that nested case. herdr injects HERDR_ENV=1 (plus
# HERDR_SOCKET_PATH/HERDR_PANE_ID) into every process it manages a pane for;
# HERDR_ENV=1 alone (no $TMUX) selects herdr. cmux injects CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID
# (plus CMUX_SURFACE_ID/CMUX_SOCKET_PATH and the legacy CMUX_TAB_ID/
# CMUX_PANEL_ID aliases) into every terminal surface it spawns - verified from
# the shipped source (`TerminalSurface+StartupEnvironment.swift`'s
# `applyManagedCmuxContextEnvironment`, which marks all five keys
# `protectedKeys`, i.e. non-overridable) and corroborated by cmux's own CLI
# (`cmux_open.swift`) reading `CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID`/`CMUX_SURFACE_ID` as its own
# ambient-target fallback, exactly how `$TMUX` and `HERDR_ENV` work for their
# backends. CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID, not CMUX_SOCKET_PATH, is the chosen marker:
# CMUX_SOCKET_PATH is independently documented as a user-settable override for
# pointing the CLI at a non-default socket, so its mere presence would not
# reliably mean "running inside a cmux-spawned terminal" the way
# CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID does. cmux is checked LAST because it is a terminal
# application (the outermost layer, like iTerm2/Terminal.app), not a session
# multiplexer - both tmux and herdr can run nested inside a cmux-provided
# shell, but cmux cannot run nested inside either of them, so a tmux or herdr
# marker set alongside CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID always means that multiplexer is the
# innermost, currently-executing layer and must win.
#
# cmux FALLBACK signals (docs/cmux-backend.md "Runtime auto-detection" owns
# the empirical record): cmux's bundled `claude` PATH shim routes through
# cmux-claude-wrapper, whose passthrough path unsets every CMUX_* variable
# before exec'ing the real binary - so a claude-harness firstmate launched in
# a cmux tab can have NO CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID at all. When that primary marker is
# absent (and only then), two macOS-only fallback signals are consulted:
#   1. __CFBundleIdentifier == com.cmuxterm.app - LaunchServices' app-identity
#      env var, inherited by every process a cmux tab spawns and NOT stripped
#      by the wrapper (it only unsets CMUX_*, TERMINFO, and CLAUDECODE).
#      Authoritative in the common wrapper-strip case, but also inherited into
#      every pane of a tmux server started from a cmux tab - the $TMUX check
#      winning FIRST is what keeps that false positive absorbed.
#   2. Process ancestry reaching the running cmux app (resolved by bundle id
#      via lsappinfo, plus a bundle-shaped `ps` comm match so the install
#      location is never hardcoded). Authoritative when the environment was
#      scrubbed entirely (no bundle id to inherit); NOT usable from inside
#      tmux, where the tmux server reparents to launchd and the chain never
#      reaches cmux - which is fine, because $TMUX already won there.
# Callers needing the winning signal read FM_BACKEND_DETECT_SIGNAL (set to
# TMUX, HERDR_ENV, CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID, bundle-id, or ancestry) and
# FM_BACKEND_DETECTED after a direct (non-command-substitution) call.
