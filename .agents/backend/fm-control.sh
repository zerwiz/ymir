# fm-control.sh - the CONTROL PLANE for a firstmate-owned agent: allowlisted
# lifecycle verbs addressed to an exact task id.
#
# Usage: fm-control.sh <task-id> interrupt
#        fm-control.sh <task-id> exit
#        fm-control.sh <task-id> relaunch [--harness <name>] [--model <name>]
#                                         [--effort <level>]
#                                         (--note <text> | --note-file <path>)
#
# Why this exists, and how it differs from fm-send.sh. bin/fm-send.sh is the
# DATA plane: conversational text for the agent to read, always routing-marked
# for a kind=secondmate target so the reply returns through the status path.
# That marking is right for a message and wrong for a lifecycle command - a
# marked "/quit" arrives as ordinary chat the agent reasons ABOUT instead of
# executing. This script is the control plane: semantic process control with a
# closed verb list, per-harness mechanics owned by an executable adapter
# (bin/fm-control-lib.sh) rather than improvised in agent prose, and a verified
# postcondition for every action. There is deliberately NO arbitrary-text and
# NO generic raw-key entry point here; fm-send remains the only way to send an
# agent something to read.
#
#   interrupt  Deliver the harness's verified interrupt sequence. The agent
#              keeps running. Postcondition: delivery succeeded, the endpoint
#              still exists, and the agent is still alive where the backend can
#              classify that. Cancellation is confirmed only from an adapter-
#              owned acknowledgement and otherwise reported unconfirmed. Busy
#              state is never rewritten as proof of the action.
#   exit       Stop the agent, preserving its terminal endpoint, worktree, and
#              every uncommitted change. Interrupts first when the task reads
#              busy, then submits the harness's exit command. Postcondition:
#              the backend's recovery-grade classifier reports the agent gone.
#              Already-stopped is success (idempotent).
#   relaunch   Transactionally replace the running agent with a new one, in the
#              SAME endpoint and SAME worktree, on the same or a newly chosen
#              harness/model/effort - so switching harness is one ordinary use
#              of this verb. With no explicit axis, a secondmate re-resolves its
#              durable config/secondmate-harness pin (harness plus its optional
#              model and effort tokens) exactly as any other respawn does, while
#              a ship or scout keeps the exact adapter already recorded for it.
#              A prefixed raw-command basename cannot reconstruct its launch
#              command, so relaunch requires an explicit --harness for it.
#              --note is required for a ship or scout, whose replacement
#              inherits the local copy but none of the conversation; a
#              secondmate reconciles its own home's records at startup, so its
#              standing charter is never rewritten.
#              Records a durable checkpoint and that note, exits the old agent,
#              then delegates the launch to its single owner,
#              bin/fm-spawn.sh --relaunch. A failure before publication keeps
#              the prior durable record in place and reports the concrete
#              state; it never leaves a half-transitioned task claiming to be
#              running.
#
# Teardown and discard are NOT verbs here and never will be. `exit` stops an
# agent and preserves everything else; removing a worktree, killing an
# endpoint, or discarding work stays with bin/fm-teardown.sh, which owns the
# landed-work test.
#
# `resume` is not a verb: it is not deterministic across the verified adapters
# (bin/fm-control-lib.sh's header owns that reasoning). `relaunch` covers the
# same need for every adapter because the brief on disk, not a harness-private
# session, is the durable instruction.
#
# Targeting is EXACT: only a bare task id with a state/<id>.meta record in
# THIS home is accepted, and the record must pass the shared endpoint-identity
# validation (bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_validate_task_endpoint). A legacy
# fm-<id> label, an explicit session:window endpoint, and a bare window name
# are all refused - a lifecycle command delivered to the wrong endpoint is far
# worse than a loud refusal.
#
# A remotely placed secondmate is refused by name: its agent runs on another
# host, so no postcondition this plane verifies could be read for it here.
#
# Fail-closed boundaries:
#   - An unverified harness, or a harness whose control mechanics are unknown,
#     is refused rather than guessed at.
#   - A backend that cannot deliver the harness's interrupt key is refused
#     (Orca's terminal API has no Escape).
#   - `exit` and `relaunch` require a backend with a recovery-grade agent-state
#     classifier (tmux, herdr), because without one the "the agent stopped"
#     postcondition cannot be proven. zellij, orca, and cmux are refused rather
#     than reported as successful blind.
#   - An ambiguous or unreadable endpoint state refuses; only a positively
#     classified state acts.
#
# Environment knobs (all bounded waits, seconds):
#   FM_CONTROL_POLL              poll interval for postcondition waits (0.5)
#   FM_CONTROL_SETTLE_WAIT       adapter acknowledgement wait after interrupt (5)
#   FM_CONTROL_EXIT_WAIT         alive->dead wait after the exit command (30)
#   FM_CONTROL_LAUNCH_WAIT       dead->alive wait after a relaunch (90)
#   FM_CONTROL_EXIT_RETRIES      Enter retries for the exit command (3)
