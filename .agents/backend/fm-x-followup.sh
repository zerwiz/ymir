# Post a completion follow-up for an X-mode-linked task, up to three within a
# 7-day window, and manage the link's counter.
#
# An X-mode mention that spawned real work is linked to its task by fm-x-link.sh
# (x_request/x_request_ts/x_followups plus optional reply context in
# state/<id>.meta). When that task reaches a genuine milestone (investigation
# done, build started, shipped, failed), firstmate composes a public-safe outcome
# and posts it here as one of up to three follow-ups, within the window. Past the
# window, past the cap, or after --final, this clears the link so a later call is
# a clean no-op.
#
# Detection (no reply text needed - cheap pre-check before composing a reply):
#   fm-x-followup.sh --check <task-id>
#     exit 0, prints <request_id>  -> a follow-up is due (linked, within window
#                                      and cap)
#     exit 1, silent               -> not linked, or window/cap exhausted (link
#                                      pruned)
#
# Clear a legacy link without posting:
#   fm-x-followup.sh --clear <task-id>
#     idempotently removes only the X follow-up metadata for a typed terminal
#     outcome.
#
# Post (after composing the reply to a file or stdin):
#   fm-x-followup.sh <task-id> [--image <path>] [--final] --text-file <path>
#   fm-x-followup.sh <task-id> [--image <path>] [--final] -
#     Linked, within window, and under the cap: posts ONE follow-up via
#       fm-x-reply.sh --followup.
#       On success: increments the counter and KEEPS the link, unless --final
#       was passed or the new count reaches the cap, in which case the link is
#       cleared instead - this is the "we're done" signal.
#       On a relay rejection distinguishing an exhausted cap/window (see
#       fm-x-reply.sh): clears the link and skips quietly, exactly like a
#       locally-detected expiry, so an old relay (which only ever supported one
#       follow-up) or an already-exhausted binding degrades gracefully instead
#       of retrying forever.
#       On fm-x-reply's fail-safe refusal (exit 8: platform or explicit budget
#       unresolved): KEEPS the link and exits non-zero. This is a
#       retryable hold, not an exhausted binding - retry once both values are
#       recoverable rather than posting with a local default.
#       On any other post failure: leaves the link in place so it can be
#       retried, exit non-zero.
#     Window or cap already exhausted: clears the link, posts nothing, exit 0
#       (silent skip).
#     Not linked: nothing to do, exit 0.
#
# --final marks this as the outcome reply: it always clears the link after a
# successful post, even if follow-ups remain under the cap. Use it for the
# final milestone (shipped, failed) so a task never leaves a stale link lying
# around waiting for a follow-up that will never come.
#
# Dry-run (FMX_DRY_RUN) flows through fm-x-reply.sh: the follow-up is recorded to
# state/x-outbox/<request_id>.json instead of posted, and the counter/link are
# mutated exactly as a live post would (increment-and-keep, or clear on --final
# / cap), so the full loop runs end to end without a public post. With --image,
# the follow-up carries one local image attachment; if the reply text splits
# into a thread, the relay attaches the image to the opener.
#
# The window is FMX_FOLLOWUP_MAX_AGE_SECS (default 604800, 7 days). The cap is
# FMX_FOLLOWUP_MAX_COUNT (default 3). FMX_NOW_OVERRIDE pins "now" for
# deterministic tests. Meta read/write lives in fm-x-lib.sh.

Post a completion follow-up (up to 3 per link, within a 7-day window) for an
X-mode-linked task and manage the link's follow-up counter.

Options:
  --check          Print the request_id when a follow-up is due.
  --clear          Clear only the X follow-up link; never post.
  --image <path>   Attach one local image file; threaded replies attach it to the opener tweet or message.
  --final          Clear the link after this post regardless of the remaining count.
  --text-file <path>
                   Read follow-up text from a file.
  -                Read follow-up text from stdin.
