# fm-task-inbox-lib.sh - the per-task steering inbox: durable records plus a
# constant doorbell.
#
# ONE owner of the steering-inbox contract: the record format, sequence
# allocation, the idempotent re-enqueue dedup, the handled/ acknowledgement,
# the self-describing doorbell line, and the watcher's re-ring ladder policy.
# bin/fm-send.sh writes and rings locally, the host-local remote steer leg
# (bin/fm-remote-secondmate-control.sh cmd_send) writes idempotently and rings
# on the remote host, bin/fm-watch.sh polls and re-rings, and the brief
# scaffold (bin/fm-brief.sh) tells the worker how to read and acknowledge;
# none of them restates the format.
#
# Design (captain-adopted, data/fm-send-reliability-reframe-s1/report.md): the
# payload moves to the filesystem, which is reliable; the terminal carries only
# a short constant doorbell line, which does not need to be reliable because
# ringing it again is free. A duplicated doorbell is a no-op by construction
# (the worker finds the inbox empty or already handled), a swallowed doorbell
# is detected by the absence of the worker's acknowledgement and re-rung on a
# bounded schedule, and a worker that never acknowledges surfaces through the
# ordinary stale wake into stuck-crewmate-recovery.
#
# Layout under <state-dir>:
#   <task>.inbox/NNN.msg       one durable steer, numeric sequence, atomic rename
#   <task>.inbox/handled/      the worker's `mv` here IS the acknowledgement
#   <task>.inbox/.seq.lock     serializes sequence allocation across writers
#                              (the session and the away daemon)
#   <task>.inbox/.ring-state   watcher re-ring ladder: "<msg>\t<count>\t<epoch>"
#   <task>.inbox/.escalated    oldest-message name already surfaced as stale,
#                              so later polls suppress another escalation
#
# Record format (fm_task_inbox_write / fm_task_inbox_body):
#   schema=fm-task-inbox.v1
#   at=<utc timestamp>
#   delivery=fire-and-forget   present only when the re-ring ladder must ignore it
#   --
#   <exact message text; newlines are legal; a marked secondmate request keeps
#    its from-firstmate marker and corr token verbatim in this body>
#
# Sequence numbers are never reused within a task: allocation scans both the
# inbox root and handled/, so a message is processed at most once per worker
# lifetime even if every doorbell is duplicated. Concurrent writers serialize
# on .seq.lock; the worst racing outcome is ordering, never loss.
#
# Re-ring ladder (fm_task_inbox_due_action): an unhandled message older than
# FM_TASK_INBOX_GRACE_SECS is due one delivery attempt per grace period; an
# attempt may ring or be skipped to protect proven pending composer text. After
# FM_TASK_INBOX_RING_MAX attempts without an acknowledgement it escalates. The
# caller owns the busy check (a busy pane just waits - the record is durable and
# the worker reaches a turn boundary) and the wake emission; this library owns
# only the schedule. If attempt bookkeeping cannot be persisted while the record
# remains unhandled, the caller surfaces that failure instead of retrying
# silently; a concurrently removed inbox is a quiet no-op. Escalation
# deliberately queues the wake before writing the
# deduplication marker: normal polls surface a message once, while a crash or
# marker failure may produce a rare duplicate rather than silently lose a wake.
#
# fm_task_inbox_ring requires bin/fm-backend.sh's dispatch (sourced below); the
# other helpers are dependency-light. Sourced by bin/fm-send.sh, bin/fm-watch.sh,
# and tests. No side effects on source beyond its sourced libraries.

# Tunables (env):
#   FM_TASK_INBOX_GRACE_SECS   default 90; delivery-attempt grace and spacing
#   FM_TASK_INBOX_RING_MAX     default 3; delivery attempts before escalation
