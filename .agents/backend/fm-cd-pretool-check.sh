# Stable PreToolUse transport for the cd-guard command policy.
#
# A stray persistent top-level `cd projects/<clone>` in the PRIMARY firstmate
# shell silently relocates the shell, so a later firstmate-owned command (a
# backlog write, an fm-* lifecycle call, tasks-axi) runs inside a project clone
# instead of the home. This seatbelt denies such a command before it runs.
# bin/fm-cd-command-policy.mjs is the sole owner of the block/allow decision; it
# reuses the shell classifier owned by bin/fm-arm-command-policy.mjs. This
# wrapper only scopes the guard to the real primary checkout, acquires the
# harness payload, invokes that policy, and renders the established harness
# responses. It never executes, sources, evaluates, or expands the command.
# See docs/cd-guard.md for the complete contract and validation record.
#
# Usage:
#   <PreToolUse JSON on stdin> | bin/fm-cd-pretool-check.sh
#   bin/fm-cd-pretool-check.sh --command '<cmd>'
#
# Stdin mode extracts .toolInput.command for Grok or .tool_input.command for
# Claude, Codex, and Cursor. CLI mode is used by OpenCode and Pi after their
# adapters extract the exact command string. --cursor selects Cursor's own deny
# rendering and marks this invocation as the Cursor registration rather than the
# Claude-settings duplicate Cursor also loads.
#
# Exit/output contract (identical shape to bin/fm-arm-pretool-check.sh):
#   ALLOW - exit 0 and no output.
#   DENY - exit 2, a Claude-shaped deny object on stderr, and a Grok-shaped
#          deny object on stdout unless --claude was supplied.
#   DENY, --cursor - exit 0 and Cursor's own decision object on stdout. Cursor
#          reads the returned object rather than the exit status.
#   INERT - not the real primary checkout (a crewmate/scout task worktree or a
#           non-firstmate repo): exit 0 with no output, exactly like ALLOW.
#   FAIL OPEN - malformed or empty stdin, missing jq for stdin transport,
#               missing Node or policy owner, or an invalid policy response.
#
# Claude requires stdout to remain empty on deny.
# Codex blocks on exit 2 and displays stderr.
# Grok consumes the stdout decision object.
# OpenCode and Pi consume exit 2 plus stderr.
# Cursor consumes the stdout decision object.

Usage: fm-cd-pretool-check.sh [--command <cmd>] [--claude|--cursor]

With no --command, reads a PreToolUse-style JSON payload on stdin (Grok
toolInput.command, or Claude/Codex tool_input.command).
Fires only in the real primary firstmate checkout; it is a silent no-op in a
crewmate/scout task worktree or any non-firstmate repo.
Exits 0 to allow and 2 to deny a persistent top-level cwd change.
The deny reason is written to stderr, with a Grok decision object on stdout
unless --claude is supplied.
With --cursor, a deny is Cursor's own decision object on stdout and exit 0,
because Cursor reads the returned object rather than the exit status.
Malformed transport and an unavailable classifier runtime fail open.

# Strict-superset prefilter (transport only; owns zero classification

# cannot hide a deniable cwd change from the policy owner. A quoting-decoder
# marker - a $ immediately followed by a
# single quote (ANSI-C $'...') or a double quote (bash locale $"...") - delegates
# too, because the classifier decodes those and can reconstruct cd from bytes
# this substring test cannot see. This marker set is COUPLED to the classifier's
# decoder set in bin/fm-arm-command-policy.mjs: adding any new quote/expansion
# form the classifier decodes REQUIRES extending it here in the same change, or
# the prefilter stops being a strict superset. Deliberate deeper obfuscation is
