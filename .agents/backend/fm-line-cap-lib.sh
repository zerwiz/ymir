# Shared per-line cap for agent-facing digest lines.
# Usage: . bin/fm-line-cap-lib.sh; fm_cap_line "<line>" [<max>]
#
# ONE OWNER for the bounded-line shape both digests use. The wake digest's
# OPEN DECISIONS section (bin/fm-wake-drain.sh) and the session-start digest's
# per-task status tails (bin/fm-session-start.sh) render the same kind of
# content - an agent-written status line, which AGENTS.md section 8 treats as a
# wake EVENT rather than current state - into a size-bounded view. An agent
# reading both must recognize one truncation marker, and the two caps must not
# drift apart, so the cut and its marker live here.
#
# Callers keep their own composite policy: fm-wake-drain.sh still owns the
# OPEN DECISIONS global byte cap and its "N more omitted" disclosure, and
# fm-session-start.sh still owns how many tail lines it prints per task. This
# file owns only the per-line cut.
#
# The cap counts characters, so a plain-ASCII line - what status lines are in
# practice - is bounded to the same number of bytes, and a multibyte character
# is never cut in half into an invalid sequence.
# Truncation stays recoverable because the session-start digest prints each
# task's full status log path, while every OPEN DECISIONS entry begins with the
# task id that identifies its durable state/<id>.status source.

# fm_cap_line_var <line> [<max>]: put <line> in FM_LINE_CAP_LINE, cut to <max>
# characters with FM_LINE_CAP_SUFFIX in place of the tail when it is longer. A
# line at or under the cap is kept unchanged, marker and all bytes intact.
# This is the rule itself. It assigns rather than prints so a caller that needs
# the value - the wake digest builds its section in a variable to weigh each
# item against a global budget - never pays a command substitution per item on
# a path that runs at the top of every wake-handling turn.
