# Watcher liveness and worktree-tangle guard, called by supervision scripts, by
# fm-wake-drain.sh after it empties queued wakes, and by fm-session-start.sh in
# read-only advisory mode whenever session-lock ownership was not verified.
# First, always warn if the firstmate primary checkout (FM_ROOT) is on a named
# non-default branch, because that means firstmate-on-itself work landed in the
# primary instead of an isolated worktree.
# Then, if a task is in flight (a state/<id>.meta exists) or X-mode relay
# polling is active (state/x-watch.check.sh exists) and supervision is not
# healthy, prints a loud, clearly delimited banner so the agent cannot skim past
# it in the tool output of whatever it was doing - the one channel every harness
# has. Supervision health is MODEL-AWARE (fm_watcher_supervision_verdict in
# bin/fm-wake-lib.sh): under the Claude Stop auto-arm model the watcher runs only
# between turns, so mid-turn a fresh beacon with no live watcher is healthy and
# only a stale beacon (beyond FM_GUARD_GRACE) is a genuine lapse; under the Pi
# extension model the extension tears the watcher down and respawns it on every
# actionable wake, so a fresh beacon with a genuinely unheld lock is healthy
# while that live Pi session provably owns continuity; any held but unhealthy
# lock is down; under every
# persistent-watcher harness a live identity-matched watcher with a fresh beacon
# is required. The banner names the true failing condition (a missing live
# watcher process vs a genuinely stale beacon). The full banner is emitted once
# per distinct down-episode in this FM_HOME (keyed to the failing condition, not
# the beacon mtime, which a healthy between-turns watcher advances every poll);
# later guarded commands in the same episode print a one-line reminder instead.
# Episode state lives only under state/.guard-watcher-stale-banner (volatile,
# bounded). Independent alarms (queued wakes, worktree tangle) are never
# suppressed by that dedup. Normal wake handling (watcher briefly down between a
# wake and the next supervision resume) stays inside the grace window and stays
# silent. Always exits 0: the guard warns, it never blocks.
