#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bin/backends/zellij.sh - the zellij session-provider adapter (EXPERIMENTAL).
#
# Design: data/fm-backend-design-d7/report.md ("Zellij Backend" section - the
# interface mapping, implementation choices, and "Zellij gaps to verify" list)
# and herdr-addendum.md D2/D3 (zellij is P3, after herdr; treehouse stays the
# worktree provider). Zellij is a session provider ONLY: the worktree provider
# stays treehouse, exactly like tmux and herdr. Sourced only through
# bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_source in normal operation; the unit tests
# source it directly.
#
# Session shape (report "Zellij implementation choices" #1, unchanged by
# empirical verification): ONE zellij session (default name "firstmate",
# overridable via FM_ZELLIJ_SESSION for test isolation - mirrors herdr's
# HERDR_SESSION), ONE tab per task, with caller-facing label "fm-<id>" and a
# home-scoped actual title. No per-home workspace split (unlike herdr's later
# P3 refinement): zellij has no workspace concept, only sessions/tabs/panes,
# so this stays exactly the report's original choice. Target string shape:
# "<zellij-session>:<pane-id>" (pane id is a bare non-negative integer with no
# embedded colon, so splitting on the FIRST colon is trivially correct and
# mirrors herdr's target-string convention).
#
# Home-scoped tab titles (closes a cross-home collision gap): because every
# task in every firstmate home - primary or secondmate - shares this ONE
# session's tab bar with no per-home split, and zellij enforces no tab-name
# uniqueness at all, two firstmate homes whose task ids happen to collide
# could send/peek/close each other's tabs. This is the exact gap a
# captain-directed no-mistakes review gate caught for the cmux backend
# (docs/cmux-backend.md) and this same tag mechanism (bin/backends/cmux.sh's
# fm_backend_cmux_scoped_title, now shared via bin/fm-backend-hometag-lib.sh)
# is ported here for the identical reason. Every NEW tab is created with a
# title tagged with this installation's home label (fm_backend_zellij_scoped_title,
# "fm-<hometag>-<id>"); every list/find/recover/kill path is scoped to this
# home's own tag. A tab created before this change carries the old untagged
# "fm-<id>" title; target_ready, kill, and ad hoc selector fallback still
# match it, but ONLY when that bare title is unambiguous (exactly one live tab
# in the session carries it) - see fm_backend_zellij_tab_matches_label and
# docs/zellij-backend.md "Home-scoped tab titles" for the full migration
# posture. Moving/relocating a firstmate installation changes its tag
# (acceptable - recorded worktree paths do not survive a move either).
#
# Empirical verification (real zellij 0.44.0, macOS aarch64, 2026-07-02;
# docs/zellij-backend.md has the full evidence log) resolved every "gaps to
# verify" item in the design report, plus additional real findings not
# anticipated by the report:
#
#   1. dump-screen on a background session with NO attached client: WORKS.
#   2. Key names: Enter -> "Enter", Escape -> "Esc" (NOT "Escape"), Ctrl-C ->
#      "Ctrl c" as ONE shell argument with an embedded space (NOT two argv
#      words, NOT "C-c" or "Ctrl+c" - all verified to fail).
#   3. `new-tab --cwd --name` DOES return the created tab's bare integer id on
#      stdout, exactly as documented.
#   4. `list-panes --json`'s `pane_cwd` reflects a `cd` run DIRECTLY in the
#      pane's own top-level shell within one poll (<0.3s) - but does NOT
#      reflect a `cd` performed by a NESTED SUBSHELL the pane's shell
#      launched as a foreground command (verified: `treehouse get` opens
#      exactly such a subshell). `pane_cwd` stays frozen at wherever the
#      pane's shell was when it invoked that foreground command - worse than
#      herdr's frozen-cwd trap (herdr at least exposes a `foreground_cwd`
#      that tracks this; zellij's CLI exposes no live-process cwd field and
#      no per-pane pid to read it from `/proc`/`lsof` either). This directly
#      contradicts the design report's assumption ("acceptable for tmux and
#      zellij") and required a different implementation strategy - see
#      fm_backend_zellij_current_path below and docs/zellij-backend.md
#      "Worktree-path discovery: pane_cwd does not track a subshell".
#   5. `new-tab` DOES steal focus from an attached client with NO flag to
#      suppress it (unlike herdr's --no-focus and tmux's new-window -d).
#      Mitigated (fm_backend_zellij_create_task): capture the previously
#      active tab id before creating, restore it with go-to-tab-by-id
#      afterward - verified to correctly restore an attached client's view
#      and to be a safe no-op with no client attached.
#
#   Additional un-anticipated findings, load-bearing for this adapter:
#   - Every pane-targeting action (write-chars, send-keys, dump-screen, ...)
#     MUST pass an explicit --pane-id. The "focused pane" default is
#     unreliable: a fresh session auto-opens a floating "About Zellij"/release
#     notes PLUGIN pane that starts FOCUSED and shadows the real terminal pane
#     - a pane-id-less send silently goes nowhere.
#   - `zellij action <subcommand>` ALWAYS exits 0, even against a nonexistent
#     session (prints the live session list to stdout, an error to stderr) or
#     a nonexistent pane id in a live session (prints nothing at all, to
#     neither stream). The exit code can NEVER be trusted to detect a bad
#     target. Mitigated: send/capture/cwd ops verify session liveness first
#     (fm_backend_zellij_session_exists, a passive list-sessions query, never
#     auto-creating), verify the specific pane still appears in list-panes JSON,
#     and, for metadata-routed task selector operations, verify the pane's tab
#     still matches the expected caller-facing task label through the home-scoped or
#     unambiguous legacy title before use. Kill verifies the session and, when
#     teardown supplies an expected tab label, verifies a tab id still matches
#     that label before closing it. Output-SHAPE validation (a bare integer tab
#     id, JSON that parses) rejects the "session not found" text fallback. A
#     pane can still die between the preflight check and the operation call;
#     docs/zellij-backend.md records that residual race.
#   - `zellij list-tabs`/`new-tab` does NOT enforce unique tab names (same as
#     herdr's tabs, unlike tmux's own window-name uniqueness), so the
#     duplicate check below is ours, mirroring both prior adapters.
#   - Closing a tab's only pane (`close-pane`) does NOT close the now-empty
#     tab (unlike herdr, where the analogous close DOES remove the tab) - an
#     empty "ghost" tab survives in `list-tabs` until explicitly closed. Kill
#     therefore always resolves the owning tab id and calls
#     `close-tab-by-id`, which verified cleanly removes a live tab (pane and
#     all) in one call - never a separate close-pane first.
#
# Requires: zellij (CLI), jq (JSON parsing). Bootstrap detects these through
# fm_backend_required_tools only when zellij is the resolved backend; this
# adapter also gates them again before spawning.

# FM_HOME fallback: every real caller already sets FM_HOME as a global before
# sourcing fm-backend.sh (which sources this file); this exists only so this
# file's own unit tests, which source it directly, resolve sanely. Mirrors
# bin/backends/herdr.sh's identical fallback; unlike herdr this adapter still
# has no per-home CONTAINER split (one shared session for every home), but
# FM_HOME/FM_ROOT now also feed fm_backend_zellij_home_label's tab-title tag
# below.
