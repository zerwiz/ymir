# bin/backends/cmux.sh - the cmux session-provider adapter (EXPERIMENTAL).
#
# Design: data/cmux-backend-feasibility-c7/report.md (adapter design sketch,
# section 4) plus the live-app verification pass recorded in
# docs/cmux-backend.md (real cmux 0.64.17, macOS aarch64, 2026-07-03). cmux is
# a session provider ONLY, exactly like herdr/zellij: the worktree provider
# stays treehouse. Sourced only through bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_source
# in normal operation; the unit tests source it directly.
#
# Container shape: cmux has no "session" layer to multiplex the way
# tmux/herdr/zellij do - there is just "the app" (one running GUI instance).
# ONE cmux workspace PER TASK (mirrors tmux's one-window-per-task / zellij's
# one-tab-per-task), with exactly one surface inside it. cmux has no session
# layer, so workspace titles are scoped by firstmate home and installation
# path inside this adapter.
#
# Target string shape: "<workspace_uuid>:<surface_uuid>" - both bare UUIDs
# with no embedded colon, so splitting on the FIRST colon is trivially
# correct (mirrors herdr's/zellij's target-string convention).
#
# GUI-first, macOS-only (docs/cmux-backend.md "Setup"): explicit selection or
# runtime auto-detection when firstmate itself is already running inside a
# cmux-spawned terminal (primary CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID marker, with documented
# macOS fallback signals for wrapper-stripped claude). Unlike Orca, cmux is a
# pure session provider (treehouse still owns the worktree) and Escape IS
# natively supported.
#
# Empirical findings from the live verification pass (docs/cmux-backend.md has
# the full evidence log) that shaped this adapter, several of which diverge
# from the original design sketch's speculation:
#
#   1. `send` (literal) does NOT auto-submit - confirmed, matches every other
#      backend's "literal-then-separate-Enter" contract.
#   2. Surface cwd is CREATION-TIME-FROZEN (zellij-shape), not live-tracking
#      (herdr-shape): `workspace list`'s `current_directory` field reflects a
#      `cd` run directly in the surface's own top-level shell, but stays
#      frozen at wherever that shell was when it launched a foreground
#      subshell (exactly what `treehouse get` does) - verified live: a nested
#      `bash -c 'cd /Users && exec bash'` left `current_directory` reporting
#      the PARENT shell's last cwd, never following into the subshell. Fixed
#      with zellij's own pwd-marker-probe workaround, reused verbatim in
#      spirit (fm_backend_cmux_current_path below).
#   3. `read-screen --lines N` has NO herdr-style small-N empty-result bug -
#      verified N=1..10 all return correctly-clamped, non-empty content. The
#      "fetch generous, trim locally" pattern is still used for consistency
#      and because the actual viewport height (not a bug - real behavior) can
#      still cap a single `read-screen` call below a caller's requested bound.
#      A DIFFERENT, unanticipated read-screen pitfall surfaced only once real
#      spawn-shaped call sequences were exercised (not caught by the original
#      Phase 1 pass, which happened to test against surfaces that already had
#      output): read-screen against a genuinely FRESH surface that has never
#      been written to yet fails outright with `internal_error: Failed to
#      read terminal text`, for every --lines value and no matter how long
#      you wait, until at least one `send` actually writes to it - after
#      which it becomes reliably readable forever. This ruled out read-screen
#      as fm_backend_cmux_target_ready's liveness probe (the design sketch's
#      original suggestion): the very first send on a freshly created task
#      would fail its own pre-flight readiness check. `list-panes` has no such
#      gap and is used instead (fm_backend_cmux_surface_exists), mirroring
#      zellij's own structural pane_exists check.
#   4. Closing a workspace's LAST surface is a THIRD shape, matching neither
#      herdr (auto-closes the workspace) nor zellij (leaves a ghost tab):
#      `close-surface` REFUSES outright with a typed error
#      (`invalid_state: Cannot close the last surface`), leaving both the
#      surface and the workspace untouched. `close-workspace` removes the
#      whole workspace (surface included) only when it is not the last
#      workspace in its window. `fm_backend_cmux_kill` handles the documented
#      last-in-window exception below, while still reclaiming every surface in
#      the task workspace.
#   5. Workspace ids do NOT survive an app relaunch - verified via source
#      (`Sources/Workspace.swift`'s only initializer unconditionally sets
#      `self.id = UUID()`, with no restored-id parameter, unlike surfaces'
#      `restoredSurfaceId ?? UUID()` path scoped to same-run object reuse).
#      No live app restart of the captain's own content was performed to
#      confirm this; see docs/cmux-backend.md for the reasoning. Recovery
#      therefore uses scoped-title matching from the caller-facing fm-<id>
#      label, never a stored uuid, mirroring herdr's/zellij's own recovery
#      posture.
#   6. NO title uniqueness enforcement for workspaces OR surfaces/tabs -
#      verified live (two workspaces, and two surfaces in one workspace, all
#      created successfully sharing one title). The duplicate check below is
#      ours, mirroring every other adapter, and uses home-scoped titles so a
#      shared cmux app cannot cross-match another firstmate home's task.
#
#   Unanticipated finding, load-bearing for this adapter: the control socket
#   defaults to `socketControlMode=cmuxOnly`, which REJECTS any CLI process
#   not spawned inside cmux itself ("Access denied - only processes started
#   inside cmux can connect"). Since firstmate always drives cmux from an
#   external shell, `automation.socketControlMode` must be one of the three
#   externally-viable modes (docs/cmux-backend.md "Setup" owns the full
#   matrix, verified from cmux source): `automation` (RECOMMENDED - same-user
#   external clients, no shared secret), `password` (works, needs
#   config/cmux-socket-password or CMUX_SOCKET_PASSWORD supplied on every
#   invocation), or `allowAll` (works, but opens the socket to every local
#   user - not recommended). `off` and `cmuxOnly` can never work externally.
#   A configured password is harmless under non-password modes: cmux's own
#   CLI sends `auth` preemptively and tolerates the server's "Unknown
#   command 'auth'" reply (cli/cmux.swift, authenticateSocketClientIfNeeded).
#
# Requires: cmux (CLI, bundled inside cmux.app - not guaranteed to be on PATH;
# see fm_backend_cmux_bin), jq (JSON parsing). Bootstrap detects these through
# fm_backend_required_tools only when cmux is the resolved backend; this adapter
# also gates them again before spawning.

# FM_HOME fallback: every real caller already sets FM_HOME as a global before
# sourcing fm-backend.sh (which sources this file); this exists only so this
# file's own unit tests, which source it directly, resolve sanely. Mirrors
# bin/backends/zellij.sh's identical fallback.

# fm_backend_cmux_kill: remove the task's whole workspace, best-effort (mirrors
# every other backend's `kill` `|| true` contract). A cmux task owns one
# workspace, so teardown reclaims that workspace and all of its surfaces.
#
# The selected-workspace teardown bug (docs/cmux-backend.md "Closing the last
# workspace in a window"): cmux keeps every window at >=1 workspace, so
# `close-workspace` on the ONLY workspace in its window silently no-ops - it
# still returns `OK`, but the workspace stays, which is exactly what left a
# selected task workspace open at teardown (the last workspace in a window is
# always the selected one). `close-window`/`window.close` cannot rescue it
# either: a window holding a live terminal session cannot be closed over the
# control socket (verified: returns success-shaped output, closes nothing).
# The reliable primitive is close-workspace on a NON-last workspace, so when the
# target is the last one in its window a throwaway sibling is created first,
# leaving that window a fresh default workspace (never an fm-<home>- title, so
# recovery/list_live ignore it) - cmux's own "closed the last tab" outcome.
