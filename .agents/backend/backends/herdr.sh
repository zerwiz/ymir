# bin/backends/herdr.sh - the herdr session-provider adapter (EXPERIMENTAL).
#
# Design: data/fm-backend-design-d7/herdr-addendum.md ("Interface mapping",
# decisions D1-D6) and the empirical verification recorded in
# data/fm-backend-design-d7/herdr-verification-p2.md (real herdr v0.7.1,
# protocol 14, macOS aarch64), refined by docs/herdr-backend.md's
# "workspace-per-home" pass (AGENTS.md task herdr-sm-spaces-k4). Herdr is a
# session provider ONLY (D3): the worktree provider stays treehouse, exactly
# like tmux. Sourced only through bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_source in
# normal operation; the unit tests source it directly, so the FM_HOME fallback
# below keeps that path sane without fm-backend.sh's preamble.
#
# Default container shape (D4, decided empirically - see
# herdr-verification-p2.md "Task container shape", refined by
# docs/herdr-backend.md "Default task container shape"): ONE herdr workspace PER
# FIRSTMATE HOME (the primary, and each secondmate, gets its own), ONE herdr TAB
# per task inside its home's workspace. The default-on presentation projection
# creates a disposable workspace for a clean fresh task instead unless the home
# opts out. That
# workspace is a non-authoritative visual projection containing only the normal
# task pane. Its random token and mutable label never authorize lookup,
# adoption, reuse, closure, deletion, task ownership, or endpoint selection.
# A version 2 journal can participate in replacing only its exact same-identity
# endpoint after metadata, home, session, workspace, tab, pane, parent, shape,
# focus, and agent-absence checks all agree under the session lock.
# Every ambiguous recovered launch uses the default flat home workspace when
# duplicate-agent risk is independently absent.
# Target resolution stays parallel to the tmux adapter in both layouts.
# Projected create, move, and cleanup operations capture the named session's
# exact active workspace and tab. On Herdr 0.7.5, an explicit close that
# empties a non-focused workspace moves focus to that workspace's neighbor
# (upstream discussion #1328, fixed by PR #1877), while a pane-death removal
# preserves focus exactly when the dying workspace sits behind the focused
# one or the focused one is last (upstream issue #1621, fixed by PR #1912);
# both fixes first shipped in Herdr 0.8.0, which is the version floor for
# default-on projection (FM_BACKEND_HERDR_MIN_PRESENTATION_VERSION). Projected cleanup
# therefore serializes under the session lock, repositions a doomed workspace
# behind the focused one when needed, and ends its verified lone idle shell
# so Herdr removes the emptied workspace through the focus-preserving
# pane-death path, with the exact pre-close tab restore as the backstop and a
# refusal to close the active tab itself.
#
# Target string shape: "<herdr-session>:<pane-id>", e.g. "default:w1:p2" (the
# pane id itself contains a colon; the session is always the FIRST field, the
# remainder is the whole pane id - fm_backend_herdr_parse_target splits on the
# first colon only). This is the value stored in a herdr task's meta window=
# field and is what fm_backend_resolve_selector already returns unchanged for
# exact task-id, legacy fm-<id>, and explicit backend-target forms (that
# function has no herdr-specific logic; it just returns meta's window=
# verbatim).
#
# Authoritative task recovery/orphan discovery (ids may not deterministically match live state
# after a server restart in a differently-configured session; see the
# verification doc) uses LABEL matching (fm-<id> tab labels), never trusts a
# stored pane id blindly: fm_backend_herdr_list_live. The presentation journal
# is deliberately excluded from that path.
#
# Requires: herdr (CLI + socket), jq (JSON parsing). Bootstrap detects these
# through fm_backend_required_tools only when herdr is the resolved backend;
# this adapter also gates them again before spawning.

# FM_HOME fallback: every real caller (fm-spawn.sh, fm-peek.sh, fm-send.sh,
# fm-teardown.sh, fm-watch.sh, fm-crew-state.sh) already sets FM_HOME as a
# global before sourcing fm-backend.sh (which sources this file), so this
# never overrides a real invocation. It exists only so this file's own unit
# tests, which source it directly without that preamble, resolve to a sane
# default (the firstmate repo root - never a secondmate home, so
# fm_backend_herdr_workspace_label falls through to "firstmate" exactly like
# pre-P3 behavior when a test does not care about home-specific labeling).

# removal plan can only avoid Herdr's focus-stealing explicit close while the
# doomed pane holds a provably lone idle childless shell; a persistent child of
# that shell (gitstatusd, a zsh-async worker, direnv) makes the plan fall back
# to the plain explicit close, which steals focus on every release without the
# two upstream focus fixes (PR #1877 commit 165dca45, PR #1912 commit a979916).
# Herdr 0.8.0 is the first release carrying both, so a home that configured
# nothing is projected only at or above it. An explicit "on" is still honored
# below the floor.
# Protocol 19 is the structural signal for that floor, measured against the real

# Herdr 0.7.5 workspace-removal focus rules (verified against the installed
# 0.7.5 binary, its v0.7.5 tag source, and the isolated named lab):
# - An EXPLICIT close that empties a workspace (API pane.close of its last
#   pane, tab close, or workspace close) routes through
#   close_selected_workspace, which assigns focus to the closing workspace's
#   right neighbor (or the new last workspace when it was last), ignoring the
#   previously focused workspace entirely (upstream discussion #1328, fixed
#   by PR #1877, commit 165dca45).
# - A PANE-DEATH removal (handle_pane_died) keeps the focused index stale,
#   which preserves the exact focused workspace whenever the dying workspace
#   sat behind it (or the focused workspace was last), and moves focus to the
#   focused workspace's right neighbor otherwise (upstream issue #1621, fixed
#   by PR #1912, commit a979916).
# Both fixes first shipped in Herdr 0.8.0 (protocol 19), verified 2026-08-05.
# Firstmate therefore removes a doomed non-focused workspace by ending its
# verified lone idle shell (the pane-death path), repositioning it behind the
# focused workspace first when needed. Moving it to the end preserves every
# other workspace's relative order, so no presentation ordering change
# persists.
# That reasoning covers the pane-death route only. The plan's plain-close
# FALLBACK is reachable exactly when the doomed pane's shell cannot be proved
# lone, childless, and idle - a persistent gitstatusd, zsh-async worker, or
# direnv fails that proof permanently - and on a release without both fixes the
# fallback is the focus-stealing close itself, so the mitigation is conditional
# rather than unconditional and a version gate IS required. Default-on
# projection is therefore floored at FM_BACKEND_HERDR_MIN_PRESENTATION_VERSION,
# where every removal primitive preserves focus and the proof stops being
# load-bearing. That floor has ONE owner, the spawn-time gate
# fm_backend_herdr_presentation_enabled, so every new projection is either on a
# supported release or is a home's deliberate below-floor opt-in. Session-start
# cleanup deliberately retires a leftover projection husk on every release,
# including below the floor. The accepted exposure is limited to the rare
# downgrade path where a home projected on Herdr 0.8.0 or newer and then moved
# to a 0.7.x release, and occurs once per leftover workspace at session start
# rather than once per task teardown; the exact prior-tab restore bounds it.
# Refusing that close below the floor would leak workspaces that nothing else
# removes and block teardown because fm-teardown treats an unconfirmed close as
# a hard stop. That cleanup is therefore authorized containment rather than a
# second gate, and the spawn-time gate remains the floor's sole owner.

# unverified and cannot establish launcher ancestry without both pane and
# socket identity. Workspace LABELS are mutable and herdr enforces no
# uniqueness on them, so a label search cannot tell one `firstmate` workspace
# from another, and herdr's globally focused workspace is whatever the captain
# happens to be looking at, not the launcher's.
#
# The injected HERDR_TAB_ID/HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID are deliberately NOT read as the
# answer. They are a snapshot taken when the pane's process started, and herdr
# can move a pane between tabs and workspaces afterwards without being able to
# rewrite a running process's environment. Only a live read is the CURRENT

# here never fails the caller, mirroring the fm_backend_herdr_kill `|| true`
# contract.
#
# Live-fire incident fix (2026-07-02): the prior implementation
# (fm_backend_herdr_workspace_prune_default_tabs, removed) re-derived
# "prunable" at create_task time from a pure label heuristic - exactly one
# tab, labeled "1" - run against whatever workspace fm_backend_herdr_workspace_find
# had just resolved. Herdr enforces no label uniqueness (docs/herdr-backend.md
# "Label collisions") and derives an unlabeled workspace's DISPLAYED label from
# its pane cwd's basename, so a captain launching herdr directly inside a
# directory named "firstmate" produces a workspace that looks byte-identical,
# by label alone, to firstmate's own auto-created container - one tab, label
# "1". workspace_find adopted that pre-existing (captain-owned, LIVE) workspace
# by the label match, the heuristic matched too, and the very next spawn
# closed the captain's own live pane 27ms after creating its task tab. The
# fix is structural, not another heuristic: only a workspace THIS SAME
# fm_backend_herdr_workspace_ensure call just created carries a non-empty
# seeded_tab_id at all (see FM_BACKEND_HERDR_WS_SEEDED_TAB_ID below); an
# ADOPTED workspace's seeded_tab_id is always empty, so create_task never
# calls this function for one, regardless of how its tabs happen to be
# labeled.
#
# Defense in depth on top of that gate (not the primary safety mechanism):
# re-verify <seeded_tab_id> is still present, still carries label "1" (a
# human could have renamed or repurposed it in the interim), and refuse to
# close it if its pane hosts an actively working agent per herdr's own
# agent-state detection (`agent get`) - belt-and-suspenders against any other
# unforeseen path landing a live agent in a tab this function was about to
# close.
#
# Verified real-herdr behavior (not modeled by the canned-response fake-CLI
# unit tests; modeled by make_herdr_statefake): closing a workspace's LAST
# remaining tab deletes the whole workspace, not just the tab. So this must
# never run while the seeded default tab is still the ONLY tab in the
# workspace - callers only invoke it once at least one other (real task) tab
# exists alongside it, never right after workspace creation - and this
# function independently re-checks the tab count as a second layer.

# fm_backend_herdr_create_task: create the task's tab (one pane) in
# <container> ("session:workspace_id"). Herdr does NOT enforce label
# uniqueness itself (verified: two tabs can share a label), so the duplicate
# check is ours, mirroring tmux's manual check.
#
# A same-labeled tab already existing no longer means an automatic refusal:
# herdr persists and restores its whole session layout (workspaces/tabs/
# panes) across a server restart, including a reboot, and a restored fm-<id>
# task tab comes back a HUSK - a dead pane, or (today, and unconditionally
# once a future `resume_agents_on_restore = false` config ships) a plain
# agent-less shell sitting in the saved cwd, never the crewmate that used to
# be there. Before this fix, every fleet respawn after such a restart needed
# the operator to manually close each husk pane first before firstmate could
# spawn into it again. fm_backend_herdr_tab_is_husk classifies the existing
# tab's pane conservatively (dead or no-agent only; anything live or
# ambiguous refuses exactly as before) and, when it is a confirmed husk,
# this function CLOSES AND REPLACES it instead of refusing.
#
# Ordering is deliberate: the REPLACEMENT tab is created FIRST, and the husk
# is closed only AFTER that succeeds - never the reverse. Closing a
# workspace's LAST remaining tab deletes the whole workspace on real herdr
# (docs/herdr-backend.md "Default workspace lifecycle"), and a session-restore husk
# can legitimately be that workspace's only tab (e.g. its own seeded default
# tab was already pruned, long before the restart, by a prior real task tab
# existing alongside it). Herdr's lack of label-uniqueness enforcement is
# exactly what makes this safe: the new and the husk tab can briefly share
# the same label with no error, so the workspace never drops to zero tabs.
# This mirrors fm_backend_herdr_workspace_prune_seeded_default_tab's own
# create-before-close safety argument.
#
# --no-focus: verified tab create never focuses by default regardless of
# sibling tabs, so this is defense in depth rather than a behavior change.
# <seeded_default_tab_id> (4th arg, may be empty) is exactly the value
# fm_backend_herdr_workspace_ensure captured as FM_BACKEND_HERDR_WS_SEEDED_TAB_ID
# for THIS SAME container - non-empty only when this spawn's own
# container_ensure call just created the workspace. Once the real task tab
# above is created, this is the ONLY input that may trigger a prune, and it is
# passed by the caller, never re-derived here from tab list contents or
# labels (the live-fire self-kill fix - see
# fm_backend_herdr_workspace_prune_seeded_default_tab for the incident and
# the safety argument). An ADOPTED workspace's caller always passes an empty
# 4th arg, so this function never even queries for a prune candidate in that

# fm_backend_herdr_send_text_submit: type <text> into <target> once (raw,
# unsubmitted, via send_literal), then submit with a named Enter key, retried
# (Enter only, never retyped) until native agent-state, a cleared composer, or
# fm_composer_queued_enter_verdict confirms delivery. Verified hazard
# (herdr-verification-p2.md "slash/$ autocomplete popup"): a `/`- or
# `$`-prefixed send opens a completion popup within ~0.1s, exactly like tmux's
# claude/codex popups, so the caller's <settle> before the first Enter matters
# here the same way it does for tmux.
#
# Confirmation signal: when the target is legibly idle before Enter,
# submission is confirmed by fm_backend_herdr_wait_for_working observing a
# submit-active agent_status after Enter. Live Claude on Herdr 0.8.0 can
# keep agent_status idle for a whole landed turn, so an idle native result
# falls through to the shared composer verdict: empty is positive delivery,
# proven pending retries Enter, and retries-exhausted pending plus a
# generating busy signal is a queued Enter via
# fm_composer_queued_enter_verdict (bin/fm-composer-lib.sh).
#
# Incident (2026-07-07, followed up on 2026-07-08): a redelivery loop in the
# away-mode daemon. Root cause: composer-content submit confirmation was too
# sensitive to harness rendering details. Real claude/codex use bare prompt
# rows, and real codex adds dynamic idle suggestions after `›`; the later
# ANSI-aware composer classifier now handles that Codex shape, and idle-baseline
# submit confirmation still prefers native agent-state so a faint idle tip
# cannot block a landed send. Composer content is consulted only after native
# state stays idle, as the empty/pending owner, and for submit attempts whose
# pre-Enter agent-state baseline is not legibly idle.
#
# This also still correctly handles the earlier 2026-07-03 incident (a
# slash-command popup selection/placeholder-fill on the FIRST Enter is not a
# genuine submission) without any popup-specific logic at all: filling a
# composer placeholder never starts a turn, so agent_status simply never
# reports "working" for that Enter, the composer stays pending, and the retry
# loop below sends a second Enter exactly as it did before - the fix
# generalizes instead of special-casing the popup shape.
#
# Failure-mode analysis (the two directions the caller-facing contract must
# not get wrong - see docs/herdr-backend.md "Native agent-state submit
# confirmation" for the empirical timing behind this):
#   - Slow transition: fm_backend_herdr_wait_for_working samples repeatedly
#     across herdr's per-attempt confirmation budget (not once at the end), so a
#     transition landing partway through a window is still caught before this
#     loop gives up and sends a needless extra Enter.
#   - Instant round-trip or a native status that never leaves idle: bounded by
#     the composer fallback. A cleared composer is delivery; a proven-pending
#     composer on an idle pane is a swallow; extra Enter on an already-empty
#     composer is a no-op, not a duplicate delivery of <text>.
# Fallback path, for a harness whose native agent-state is never legibly idle
# (measured live: herdr reports a cursor pane `blocked` in every state - idle,
# mid-turn, and after - so the idle-baseline path above is structurally
# unreachable for it). That harness always lands in the composer branch, and
# cursor's mid-turn composer row renders its own placeholder beside a
# right-aligned `ctrl+c to stop`, so the content verdict is `pending` on a
# composer that holds no user text at all and every steer reported delivery
# unconfirmed on a message that had actually landed.
# The escape is the SAME semantic signal the idle-baseline path uses, read from
# the pane's verified busy footer instead of native agent-state, and it is the
# rendered-footer twin of the tmux submit core's turn-started confirmation
# (bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh): an idle-to-busy transition ACROSS our Enter is proof the
# harness accepted the submission. The baseline is taken before the first Enter
# and only when the native baseline was not legibly idle, so the idle-baseline
# path still never reads pane content until native stays idle. A pane already
# mid-turn cannot use a rendered-footer transition as proof of this Enter;
# only the separate retries-exhausted, proven-pending queued-Enter verdict can
# confirm delivery from its native working state.
# Queued-while-busy Enter (OpenCode 1.18.4, and any harness that keeps typed
# text visible until the current turn ends): after the retry budget, a proven
# pending composer plus native agent_status=working is delivered, not swallowed.
# blocked is not working, so a Cursor pane that is blocked in every state does
# not receive this conversion. On an idle native baseline, a rendered busy
# footer may supply the same generating signal because live Claude never leaves
# idle. The policy is fm_composer_queued_enter_verdict; this adapter only
# supplies the busy primitive.
# Echoes empty|pending|unknown|send-failed, a subset of the proof-carrying
# submit vocabulary. Empty means confirmed submitted for every backend; how
# each backend confirms it is an internal decision.
#
# fm_backend_herdr_queued_enter_busy: delivery-busy for the shared queued-Enter
# conversion. Native agent_status=working is generating; blocked is not (a
# permission prompt, or Cursor's always-blocked native state, is not a queued
# mid-turn). When <allow-rendered> is 1, an idle native baseline may also take
# the pane's rendered busy footer, because live Claude keeps agent_status idle

# --- native event push: pane.agent_status_changed subscriber -----------------
#
# The push half of the immediate blocked-state escalation (AGENTS.md section 8,
# docs/herdr-backend.md "Native pane.agent_status_changed push escalation").
# fm_backend_herdr_wait_transition is the watcher's bounded wait primitive for
# herdr homes: instead of a blind sleep, it blocks on herdr's native event
# stream and returns the instant a subscribed pane transitions to `blocked`, so
# a crew waiting on the human wakes its supervisor sub-second instead of after
# the ~240s stale-pane wedge timer. Everything not `blocked` is streamed too
# (the policy, not the subscription, makes `blocked` the sole immediate action)
# so `working` edges clear the per-pane dedupe marker. Polling stays the
# permanent fail-closed backstop: below-capability, a connect/subscribe failure,
# or a missing reader all fall back to the caller sleeping the same budget.

# fm_backend_herdr_socket_path: the control-socket path for <session>, read from
# `herdr session list --json` (the default session's socket differs from a named
# session's - verified: default -> ~/.config/herdr/herdr.sock, named ->
# ~/.config/herdr/sessions/<name>/herdr.sock). Empty on any failure.
