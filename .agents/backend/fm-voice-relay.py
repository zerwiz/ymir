"""fm-voice-relay.py - hold the Nova Sonic session on this desktop, on behalf of the laptop.

The captain talks into their laptop. The laptop captures audio and streams it
over the SSH connection it already has to this desktop. This relay holds the
Bedrock bidirectional session, answers the model's tool calls from firstmate's
records, and streams the spoken reply back down the same connection. AWS
credentials therefore stay on this desktop and never go near the laptop, which
is the whole reason for the shape.

The voice agent this relay runs is NOT firstmate. It stands in front of
firstmate: it answers questions about the fleet from the records, and when the
captain asks for real work it says out loud that it is handing the request over
and then queues it. It never claims to have done the work.

Modes:
  --serve            read fm_voice_frame frames on stdin, write them on stdout.
                     This is what the laptop client runs over SSH, and the
                     default when no mode is given.
  --self-test FILE   feed one raw 16 kHz PCM file into a session as if it had
                     arrived from the client, print the timings as JSON, exit.
                     This is the control measurement for the relay path, and it
                     needs no client, no SSH and no microphone.

The two traps this code already avoids, both found the expensive way and both
measured rather than assumed:

  1. completionEnd does not arrive on its own. The model holds the session open
     waiting for more speech. The real "the reply is finished" signal is a
     contentEnd carrying stopReason END_TURN.
  2. Audio with no trailing silence is truncated and never answered, even when
     contentEnd follows immediately. A push-to-talk release supplies no trailing
     silence at all, so this relay appends its own on talk end. --tail-ms sets
     how much. Measured here, the tail is a content requirement and not a time
     one: nothing was answered at 0 or 100 ms, everything was answered from
     200 ms up, and 200 through 800 ms all landed in the same spread because the
     silence is sent unpaced. The 400 ms default is margin that costs nothing.

Read scope, deny list and the handover queue all belong to bin/fm_voice_records.py.
bin/fm_voice_frame.py owns the wire contract between the two machines, and
docs/voice-relay.md is the operator-facing guide.

CONFIGURATION. The region, the model and the AWS profile name somebody's account
and somebody's choices, so this file carries no default for them. Each is read
from the home's gitignored config/ directory, or from the matching environment
variable, and a missing one refuses with the path to write rather than reaching
for a value that belongs to another home. That configuration is also the opt-in:
an unconfigured home cannot start this relay at all.

  config/voice-region   FM_VOICE_REGION   Bedrock region.        required
  config/voice-model    FM_VOICE_MODEL    Nova Sonic model id.   required
  config/voice-profile  FM_VOICE_PROFILE  AWS profile.           optional
  config/voice-id       FM_VOICE_ID       output voice.          default matthew

An absent profile means the relay uses only credentials that are already in its
environment. An empty FM_VOICE_PROFILE, or an empty `--profile ""`, forces that
even when config/voice-profile exists.

On choosing the model: the first-generation Nova Sonic model is marked legacy by
AWS and measured 25 percent slower on the tool-backed path, which is the path this
interface actually uses, so the figures in docs/voice-relay.md were taken against
the second generation, which that document names.

    second to each turn after the first. The relay resolves once at start and
    every later session reuses that answer, so a reconnect costs a reconnect
    and not a credential fetch.

    Credentials that carry an expiry are refreshed a few minutes ahead of it,
    because a relay left running outlives them. One whose expiry cannot be read
    is held for that same margin and no longer, so an unreadable deadline costs
    an occasional resolution rather than every session after the deadline. The
    margin is handed to the resolver as well, because credentials taken from the
    environment cannot be refreshed in place and have to be abandoned for the
    profile once they are that close to the end.

    That abandonment has to be remembered, not just decided. os.environ never
    gets fresher values while this process runs, so re-reading it after giving up
    on an ambient credential would hand back the same stale keys forever and the
    bound above would be a bound in name only. Once an ambient answer is spent,
    this asks the profile from then on.

    An ambient answer is only ever spent when there IS a profile to spend it on.
    With no profile the environment is the only source, so the bound becomes a
    re-read of it rather than an escalation: a relay configured that way keeps
    answering, and whether the keys still work is between AWS and the operator
    who exported them.

    MEASURED, and the reason this exists: a second user audio block in a session

    Six consecutive turns were tried with no wait, with a wait until the reply's
    audio had all arrived, and with a wait of the reply's full spoken duration
    after that; every one of those interrupted every second turn. Worse, an
    interrupted turn that calls a tool is then lost outright: the model asks for
    the tool, takes the result, and never answers.

    Reconnecting instead costs 0.02 seconds, measured, and it happens when the
    captain presses the talk key rather than while they are waiting for a reply,
    so it is invisible. What it gives up is conversational memory: each turn
    starts fresh, so the captain cannot say "and what about that one". Carrying
    context across turns means handling barge-in properly, which is step three of
    the design, not this build. It also means the system prompt is sent once per
