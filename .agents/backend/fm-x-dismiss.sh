# Dismiss a pending X-mode mention at the relay WITHOUT replying to it.
#
# Usage: fm-x-dismiss.sh <request_id>
#
# When firstmate decides NOT to reply to a mention (a pure acknowledgment, or any
# mention it judges not worth a reply), clearing only the local inbox file is not
# enough: the relay keeps re-offering that request on every poll until it times
# out to a polite "offline" auto-reply. Dismiss tells the relay to drop the
# request outright - it posts nothing and stops re-offering it - so a skipped
# mention causes no re-offer churn and no offline auto-reply.
#
# POSTs {"request_id":"<id>"} (no text - a dismiss has no body) to
# $RELAY/connector/dismiss with the bearer token. On success (2xx) it echoes ONLY
# the request_id and clears the request's durable per-request reply context
# (state/x-context/<id>.json; a dismissed mention never gets a follow-up); on a
# non-2xx (or transport failure) it exits non-zero so the caller knows the
# dismiss did not land and can fall back to leaving the inbox file for a later
# pass.
#
# Live post config (home .env, FMX_ENV_FILE, or env): FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN
# (required), FMX_RELAY_URL (default https://myfirstmate.io). Auth:
# Authorization: Bearer <token>.
#
# Preview / dry-run: with FMX_DRY_RUN set (truthy), nothing is posted. Instead the
# would-be POST body ({request_id}) is recorded to state/x-outbox/<request_id>.json
# with an "endpoint":"dismiss" marker so the preview is self-describing (the live
# POST body stays {request_id}), a "DRY RUN" summary is printed to stderr, and
# stdout still echoes the request_id with exit 0. Dry-run needs neither a token
# nor the relay.
