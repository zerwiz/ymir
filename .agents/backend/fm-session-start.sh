# fm-session-start.sh - one command for the whole session start.
#
# Collapses AGENTS.md sections 3 (bootstrap) and 5 (recovery) into ONE script
# producing ONE ordered digest, so a session starts in one or two turns
# instead of the six-plus separate reads the old docs required: run
# fm-bootstrap.sh, then separately read data/projects.md, data/secondmates.md,
# data/captain.md, data/captain-shared.md, data/learnings.md, then run
# fm-lock.sh, fm-wake-drain.sh, then read data/backlog.md, every state/*.meta,
# and every state/*.status.
# Every one of those reads is UNCONDITIONAL at every session start, so they
# belong in a script, not in N agent turns.
#
# COMPOSITION, NOT DUPLICATION: this script calls fm-lock.sh, fm-bootstrap.sh,
# fm-wake-drain.sh, and fm-startup-network.sh as real subprocesses and prints
# their real output. It never re-implements their logic; all
# sequencing/formatting logic added here stays local to this file. Those four
# scripts remain fully working
# standalone with unchanged default behavior - other flows (fm-bootstrap.sh
# install <tools> after consent, /updatefirstmate, the afk daemon, existing
# tests) still call them directly. The one seam this script needed -
# bootstrap running its detect-only diagnostics without its six mutating
# sweeps - is an opt-in FM_BOOTSTRAP_DETECT_ONLY=1 flag on fm-bootstrap.sh
# itself (default unset/0 = unchanged behavior), not a fork.
#
# ORDERING, and why LOCK now runs before BOOTSTRAP (the old AGENTS.md order
# was bootstrap-then-lock):
#
#   1. lock          - acquire the per-home session lock FIRST, before any
#                       mutating step runs.
#   2. bootstrap      - home-local stale Herdr projection cleanup runs only
#                       when this session actually holds the lock. Detect-only
#                       diagnostics always run. Bootstrap's six MUTATING sweeps
#                       (same-home backlog reconciliation,
#                       secondmate convergence, secondmate liveness, pending remote
#                       handoff retry, X-mode artifact writes, fleet sync) also run only when
#                       locked; the four network sweeps run in the deferred
#                       stage rather than this synchronous bootstrap section.
#   3. inactive outcomes + wake-drain - runs the local bounded inactive-outcome
#                       reconciliation before presenting durable wakes and advancing
#                       recovery handling state, so both only run when locked.
#   4. supervision-instructions - the one emitted operating block for the
#                       detected primary harness.
#   5. read-once contract - the do-not-re-read contract covering every source
#                       represented by the two digests below.
#   6. fleet digest   - a compact data/backlog.md identity/metadata listing,
#                       every state/*.meta, a bounded state/*.status tail,
#                       state/.afk, and a cheap per-task endpoint-liveness read:
#                       read-only, always runs.
#   7. network checks - the result of the deferred network stage started back at
#                       step 1, harvested WITHOUT waiting for it.
#   8. context digest - data/projects.md, data/secondmates.md, data/captain.md,
#                       data/captain-shared.md, data/learnings.md: read-only,
#                       always safe, always runs.
#   9. closing reminder - prints the context-specific watcher next step; this
#                       script points back to the emitted harness supervision
#                       block and deliberately never arms the watcher itself.
#
# Those nine names are also the runtime-bound stage list below, so a truncated
# startup can name exactly which of them never ran.
#
# NO NETWORK ON THE BLOCKING PATH. This digest runs on a session-open hook that
# blocks session initialization, so anything it waits for is time the captain
# waits before the first turn - and every external-network call it used to make
# was individually unbounded. One unreachable remote secondmate could burn the
# entire FM_SESSION_START_TIMEOUT and truncate the digest, so a slow network
# could cost the work queue itself.
# So no step between here and the last line below makes an external-network
# call. The five that did - `gh auth status`, secondmate liveness, secondmate
# convergence, pending remote handoff delivery, and the fleet-sync fetch - are
# started as one detached bounded worker right after the lock (step 1) and
# harvested at step 7 without ever blocking on it. bin/fm-startup-network.sh
# owns that stage and its safety argument; bin/fm-bootstrap.sh remains the owner
# of the sweeps themselves and still runs every one of them.
# The digest is therefore composed from local reads and local subprocesses only,
# and an unreachable host now delays a reported check rather than the startup.
# What this deliberately trades: on a slow network the digest prints "IN
# PROGRESS" and names exactly which checks are not yet confirmed, instead of
# waiting for them. It never reports an unconfirmed check as passed.
#
# ORDERING, and why FLEET STATE now runs before CONTEXT: this digest is
# delivered through a harness that truncates an oversized payload from the TAIL,
# and it has really been truncated in practice - a 70KB digest arrived as lines
# 1-435 of 578, cutting off eight lines before the live-task inventory. What a
# truncated tail drops must therefore be the CHEAPEST thing to lose. Curated
# memory is stable session to session, is already governed by a captain-set
# budget (config/startup-memory-budget), and is recoverable with one targeted
# read; live fleet identity - which tasks exist, their windows, worktrees,
# backends, and endpoint liveness - changes every session and is exactly what
# recovery depends on. So fleet state goes first and the memory files absorb the
# truncation. The read-once contract moves ahead of both for the same reason: a
# contract that only arrives after the payload it governs is the first thing a
# truncated digest loses, and it carries the truncation caveat that keeps it
# honest when a stage below it never ran.
# The LOCK/BOOTSTRAP/WAKE-QUEUE safety preamble keeps its order: it establishes
# mutation authority and this turn's work queue before anything else is read.
#
# On a Pi primary, the supervision-block step also checks whether Pi's two
# tracked primary extensions are loaded and prints a PI_WATCH_EXTENSION
# reminder line when one is missing.
#
# Why lock first: the old documented order (bootstrap, THEN lock) let a
# SECOND concurrent session run bootstrap's mutating sweeps - converging
# secondmate homes, retrying pending handoff outboxes, writing X-mode artifacts,
# and fetching or fast-forwarding every project clone - before ever discovering
# another session already holds the lock. Two sessions racing those sweeps is
# exactly the hazard the lock exists to prevent, so locking first closes the
# hole outright: only the session that actually wins the lock ever touches
# shared mutable state.
#
# The tradeoff this ordering accepts: a refused (read-only) session must not
# go dark. So on refusal, bootstrap still runs (in FM_BOOTSTRAP_DETECT_ONLY=1
# mode) for its local read-only detect lines - missing tools, the worktree-tangle
# check, the harness override, crew-dispatch validation, tasks-axi and quota-axi
# tool checks, and tasks-axi availability - none of which mutate shared state
# and all of which are safe to compute without verified lock ownership.
# It deliberately skips the network-only GitHub-auth probe because a read-only
# session has no dispatch, spawn, steer, or merge action for that verdict to gate.
# Only projection cleanup, the six bootstrap mutating sweeps, and wake-queue
# presentation are skipped.
# The context and fleet-state digests
# below are always read-only, so they run unconditionally in both modes.
#
# BACKLOG DIGEST: the startup listing is a RECOVERY input, not a reporting
# surface, so it carries what this turn can act on and nothing else.
#   - `done` rows are never listed. Retained completion history belongs to the
#     reporting surfaces (bin/fm-bearings-snapshot.sh, /ahoy), and at startup it
#     is pure weight - 10 done rows cost 3.3KB in an observed main-home digest.
#   - Every in-flight, held, and blocked row is listed IN FULL, with its
#     hold_kind/hold_reason and blocked_by. Those are the rows AGENTS.md
#     sections 7 and 10 make actionable at startup, so they are never bounded
#     away.
#   - Only the plain queued (dispatchable-now) listing is bounded, by
#     FM_SESSION_START_QUEUED_LIMIT, default 20. Anything it omits is disclosed
#     with an exact remainder count and the command that shows the rest, so a
#     deep queue costs a counter rather than kilobytes.
#     (This replaces FM_SESSION_START_BACKLOG_LIMIT, which bounded the whole
#     listing indiscriminately and so could drop a held or blocked row.)
# When compatible tasks-axi is selected and available, the shared tasks-axi
# backend probe remains the compatibility owner and this script asks
# `tasks-axi list` for the compact identity fields plus blocked_by, hold_kind,
# and hold_reason, never body. The groups are the tool's own filters
# (`--state in_flight`, `--state held`, `--state queued --blocked`, and
# `tasks-axi ready`), so this script never reimplements task state; the groups
# can overlap, because an in-flight item that is also held appears under both.
# When manual mode is selected, or tasks-axi is unavailable or incompatible,
# this script prints only backlog section headings and item title lines, so
# title-line hold and blocked-by metadata remain visible while indented bodies
# stay out of the startup digest; the same never-bound-a-held-or-blocked-row
# rule applies, recognized there from the title line's own hold/blocked-by
# markers.
# Full bodies are targeted follow-up only: `tasks-axi show <id> --full` when
# compatible tasks-axi is available, or `data/backlog.md` when the file body is
# truly needed.
#
# STATUS TAILS: FM_SESSION_START_STATUS_TAIL bounds how many lines each task's
# tail prints, and bin/fm-line-cap-lib.sh bounds how long each of those lines
# may be. Both bounds are safe because the section prints every task's full
# status log path, and AGENTS.md section 8 treats a status line as a wake EVENT
# rather than current state - bin/fm-crew-state.sh owns current state.
#
# RUNTIME BOUND: the digest is now executed through a native session-open
# adapter (see bin/fm-sessionstart-run.sh), which blocks either hook-driven
# session initialization or Pi's first provider preflight while it runs, so an
# unbounded digest is no longer merely slow - it can strand a whole session or
# first turn behind one hung subprocess. Every remaining step is local, but
# local is not the same as bounded: tool version probes, the backlog listing,
# and the per-task endpoint reads are all unbounded subprocesses. So the whole
# digest still runs as ONE bounded child of this script
# (FM_SESSION_START_TIMEOUT, default 120s). The deferred network stage
# deliberately sits OUTSIDE that bound,
# in its own process group under its own aggregate deadline, so a truncated
# digest neither waits for it nor orphans it unbounded. The
# child writes the digest straight to this script's stdout, so everything it
# emitted before the bound was hit is already delivered; the parent then prints
# a loud STARTUP TRUNCATED banner naming the stage that did not finish and the
# sections that were therefore never emitted, and still exits 0. The child
# records its progress in FM_SESSION_START_STAGE_FILE, which is also the flag
# that tells a child it is the child - the parent never recurses.
# Hosts without timeout, gtimeout, or perl use the shared pure-Bash watchdog, so
# the digest never runs without the same hard bound and process-group cleanup.
#
# Usage: fm-session-start.sh [--reemit] [--source <source>]
#   Prints the full ordered digest to stdout and always exits 0: this is a
#   reporting command, not a gate. A lock refusal is reported as a loud
#   banner inline, never a silent failure or a non-zero exit that would make
#   an agent skip the rest of the digest.
#
#   --reemit  This process ALREADY took the helm at its own startup and has
#             only lost its context (a /clear or a compaction). Skip the
#             mutating sweeps that startup already reconciled - the stale Herdr
#             projection cleanup and bootstrap's six mutating sweeps (fleet
#             sync, same-home backlog reconciliation, secondmate convergence and
#             liveness, pending remote handoff retry, X-mode
#             artifact writes) - and
#             re-emit the rest. Wake-queue presentation is NOT skipped: queued
#             records are this turn's work queue, they arrived after startup,
#             and a session that owns the lock is exactly the session that must
#             handle and acknowledge them. Lock acquisition still runs, because
#             ownership must be re-verified rather than assumed: fm-lock.sh already treats a lock
#             this session's own harness holds as its own, so the re-emit
#             proceeds, while a lock another live session took meanwhile still
#             produces the ordinary read-only path.
#
#   --source  The native session-open source, supplied only by
#             fm-sessionstart-run.sh. A genuine `startup` that owns the active
#             session lock records AGENTS.md's SHA-256 baseline only after the
#             digest completion record is published, keyed to that lock's
#             harness pid. No resume, clear, reset, compact, or other rebuild
#             creates or replaces it. Pi and pi-signed compaction are the only
#             supported stale-cache rebuild pair: a missing baseline, a baseline
#             for another harness pid, or a changed hash causes the complete
#             current AGENTS.md to print before the bulky digest. The baseline
#             remains immutable so every later drifted compaction refreshes
#             again, while an equal baseline emits no instruction refresh.

point of this command.

Go to a source directly only when:
  - this digest flagged it ABSENT (then rebuild or create it per AGENTS.md),
  - its contents looked unparseable or corrupt,
  - an individual full status log is needed for older wake-event history, or a
    status line was capped and its tail matters (each task's full log path is
    printed with its tail),
  - a full task body is needed (tasks-axi show <id> --full, or data/backlog.md),
  - the backlog listing disclosed omitted queued items and this turn needs them,
  - the NETWORK CHECKS section reported its checks still IN PROGRESS and this
    turn needs their verdict (bin/fm-startup-network.sh report),
  - or a STARTUP TRUNCATED banner named the stage that would have printed it, in
    which case that stage's sources were never emitted and must be reconciled.
