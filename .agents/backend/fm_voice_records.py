"""fm_voice_records.py - what the voice agent is allowed to know, and how it hands work over.

The voice agent answers status questions from firstmate's durable records and
queues everything else. This module owns both halves, because both halves are
where a mistake is expensive: one sends the captain's records to a model in
another region, and the other writes to firstmate's wake queue.

WHAT IS NEVER READ. Two whole classes of record are excluded at every scope,
not filtered at the end:

  Done history, because a spoken "what is happening" answer is about open work,
  and the finished items are where old engagements accumulate.
  Free-form note bodies under a task, because they are long, they are written
  for a reader with the whole file in front of them, and they are where
  commercial detail gets quoted.

Only open task lines and this home's own runtime records are ever assembled.
That is a confidentiality boundary as much as a brevity one. Verified on the
captain's live records on 2026-08-21: every occurrence of the one engagement
identifier those records contain sits in Done history or a note body, so
nothing in a full status answer named a customer. tests/fm-voice-relay.test.sh
holds that boundary as an executable check, so widening the reader later fails
the test rather than quietly widening what is sent.

Runtime records outlive the work they describe: a task keeps its state/<id>.meta
until teardown removes it, which happens separately from marking the item done.
Two readings here treat that differently, on purpose.

  Pull requests, the count and the list, cover OPEN ids only. They name work, and
  they feed the deny decision, which needs an open item to take a title from. A
  finished task's pull request is therefore not counted and not named, and that
  lost count is a deliberate cost: the alternative names finished work and puts
  it out of reach of the deny list, which has no title to match without an open
  item to take it from.

  The worker count and the state histogram cover every live runtime record,
  finished ids included, because a task with a meta file still on disk is still
  on deck and still needs tearing down. That is the question those two figures
  answer, and it is the same meaning bin/fm-inbox.sh gives "workers" in the human
  rendering. Neither can carry record free text: one is an integer, and the
  other's keys are the state verb folded through the closed set below.

READ SCOPE. config/voice-read-scope selects what a status answer may contain:

  counts (the default, and the value used when the file is absent)
      Counts, states and one basis note, with no record free text assembled at
      all. Safe by construction rather than by filtering: the agent can say how
      much is waiting without saying what it is. This is the default because a
      home that has configured nothing has granted nothing, and sending task
      identifiers, titles and pull request links to a model in another region is
      not something to inherit from somebody else's settings file.

  full
      Counts plus the identifiers, titles and pull request links of open work.
      A home widens to this by writing `full` into config/voice-read-scope,
      which is the access being granted deliberately by the captain whose
      records they are.

DENY LIST. config/voice-read-deny holds anything that must never leave this
host even in full scope: one plain case-insensitive substring per line, `#`
starts a comment, blank lines ignored. Substrings rather than regular
expressions, because a confidentiality list is the wrong place for a pattern
that can match more or less than it looks like it matches. Each open item is
matched once, against its identifier, its title, its tag values and its pull
request link together, and a match is then withheld from every list it could
have appeared in and reduced to a withheld count. One decision per item rather
than one per list, because an item named in any list is an item that left this
host. The agent still says how much is waiting without saying what it is. The
file is optional and an absent file means an empty list; it exists so that a
future open task carrying a customer name can be excluded in one line rather
than by turning the whole feature down.

WORKER STATE. This module reports the last recorded event verb, which is
history rather than a live check, and labels it that way in its own output so
the model cannot present it as current truth. bin/fm-crew-state.sh remains the
owner of real current-state reconciliation and is far too slow for a spoken
answer. The verb is folded through the closed STATE_VERBS vocabulary below, and
anything outside it becomes "note": a status line is free text, and this verb is
the only thing derived from a record that a counts-scope answer says out loud.

bin/fm-inbox.sh `status` is the human rendering of the same records and stays
the owner of that. This module exists because a spoken answer needs a machine
shape and a read scope that the human rendering has no reason to carry.

Usage:
  fm_voice_records.py status [--home <dir>] [--scope counts|full]
  fm_voice_records.py queue <text>... [--home <dir>]

Both subcommands print JSON, which is exactly what the relay hands to the model
as a tool result, so the shell form is the same interface the relay uses.
