#
# A remote job worker (bin/fm-remote-job-worker.sh) is launched from a specific
# Firstmate code root: the account's own checkout under the LaunchAgent, a
# remote secondmate's checkout, a no-mistakes gate worktree, a pooled task
# worktree, or a test fixture root. When that root is pruned while the worker is
# running, the worker is reparented to init and, on older builds, keeps polling
# and logging indefinitely. Current workers stop themselves once their root is
# gone (bin/fm-remote-job-worker.sh); this sweep is the belt-and-suspenders pass
# that clears workers already orphaned that way, including ones started before
# self-termination shipped.
#
# The reap condition is exactly fm_remote_job_root_is_live failing for the root
# named in the worker's own command line. That is deliberately the whole test:
# a worker whose root is gone can never claim, validate, or execute another job,
# and no healthy worker can present a missing root. The account's healthy
# LaunchAgent worker, a live remote secondmate's worker, and any worker whose
# checkout still exists are therefore never candidates, with no dependence on
# log paths, process age, or which home is sweeping.
#
# Only this user's processes are inspected, and this process, its own process
# group, and any ancestor are never signalled. Each candidate is stopped through
# the shared fm_remote_job_stop_worker_tree, so the whole worker tree goes at
# once (TERM first, KILL only for a survivor) and a group whose leader is not
# itself a worker is stopped as a single process instead.
#
# Prints one line per reaped or surviving candidate and nothing when there is
# nothing to do. Exits 0 unless the process scan itself could not run, so a
# caller can sweep without risking its own outcome.

Usage: fm-remote-job-reap-orphans.sh [--dry-run]

Stop every remote job worker whose Firstmate code root has been pruned. A
worker whose root still exists - the account's LaunchAgent worker, a live
remote secondmate's worker - is never a candidate. --dry-run reports the
candidates and signals nothing. Read this script's header for the full rule.
