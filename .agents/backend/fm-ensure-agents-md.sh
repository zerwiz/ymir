# Ensure a project worktree follows the agent-memory file convention.
# AGENTS.md is the real project-intrinsic knowledge file; CLAUDE.md is a
# real regular file whose canonical content is the two-line @AGENTS.md pointer
# that Claude Code inlines at load time. Creates a minimal AGENTS.md skeleton
# when neither file exists, promotes a real CLAUDE.md file when it is the only
# file present (unless it is already the canonical pointer), converts a correct
# CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md symlink into the pointer file, and refuses to clobber
# distinct real files or wrong symlinks.
# Owns the canonical "## Maintaining this file" self-governance wording for
# project AGENTS.md files, injecting it idempotently into created skeletons,
# promoted CLAUDE.md files, and any existing AGENTS.md that still lacks it.
# Owns the canonical CLAUDE.md pointer content (the exact two-line @AGENTS.md
# form). A real-file pointer cannot follow a write into AGENTS.md, which is why
# the installer never creates a CLAUDE.md symlink.
# Refuses a case-variant real memory file such as a lowercase agents.md, so the
# pointer's @AGENTS.md import resolves to a real AGENTS.md on a case-sensitive
# filesystem (issue #389). The real-file pointer also eliminates the old
# uppercase-literal-target dangling-symlink hazard that a CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md
# link would have carried for that same mismatch.
# This is a worktree utility for crewmates, not a supervision script, so it does
# not call fm-guard.sh.
