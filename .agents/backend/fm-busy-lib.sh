# fm-busy-lib.sh - the ONE owner of firstmate's semantic busy-state contract.
#
# Design source: the captain-approved semantic busy-state redesign
# (2026-07-28): each harness adapter reports turn lifecycle through a
# machine-readable semantic source it owns, classification always exposes
# which source produced it, and missing, malformed, stale, unsupported, or
# unverified semantic data is UNKNOWN - never idle. Endpoint death is the only
# process-level override and yields dead, never busy. Child processes, CPU,
# process sleep state, marker mtimes, and the old global UI-regex OR are not
# state signals here; state/<id>.turn-ended files remain wake NOTIFICATIONS
# owned by the watcher, not current-state truth.
#
# Record file: state/<id>.busy-state - exactly one line, atomically replaced
# by bin/fm-busy-event.sh (the only writer):
#
#   v1 gen=<token> seq=<uint> state=<busy|idle|unknown> source=<token> event=<token> ts=<epoch>
#
# Gen sidecar: state/<id>.busy-gen - one token minted when the task's busy
# wiring is armed (fm-spawn, or a documented recovery re-arm). Every event
# must present the current gen; an event or record carrying any other gen is
# a stale incarnation and is rejected (written events) or classified unknown
# (read records). seq is a strictly increasing integer per gen, advanced
# under the writer's lock, so an out-of-order apply can never regress a
# newer record.
#
# Semantic sources written by adapters (fm_busy_sources_for_harness owns the
# per-harness trust table; a record whose source is not trusted for the
# task's recorded harness classifies unknown, so one adapter's writer can
# never classify another adapter):
#   pi-ext           Pi/pi-signed per-task extension (agent_start/agent_settled)
#   opencode-plugin  OpenCode per-task plugin (session.status)
#   claude-hook      Claude lifecycle hooks (UserPromptSubmit/Stop/StopFailure/SessionEnd)
#   codex-hook, codex-appserver  reserved: Codex, gated by
#                    fm_busy_codex_semantic_source
#   kimi-wire, kimi-hook  reserved: standalone Kimi, gated by fm_busy_kimi_verified
# Firstmate-owned sources accepted for every converted adapter:
#   fm-spawn         the launch-brief turn seeded at spawn
#   fm-interrupt     the legacy Claude fm-send --key Escape idle event
#   fm-recovery      a documented recovery reset after relaunch
# Classifier-only sources (never written into a record):
#   endpoint-gone, herdr-native, grok-regex, muse-session-log,
#   cursor-transcript, missing, malformed, gen-mismatch, source-mismatch,
#   kimi-unverified, codex-unverified, capture-failed, no-target
#
# Classification (fm_busy_classify): busy | idle | unknown | dead, always
# with the producing source as the second token. Precedence:
#   1. dead endpoint (fm_busy_classify_live only) -> dead endpoint-gone
#   2. standalone Kimi before verification       -> unknown kimi-unverified
#   3. a valid, gen-matching, source-trusted record -> its state and source
#   4. no record at all: herdr's native busy verdict is trusted as busy
#      (generation state is sufficient for busy, not for idle), then the
#      muse session-log and cursor transcript pull sources, then the Grok-only
#      temporary regex fallback classifies a grok task from its rendered tail,
#      then unknown missing
#   5. malformed, stale, or untrusted records -> unknown, never a fallback
# The Grok arm is the ONLY rendered-text classification that survives the
# redesign, because Grok's structured lifecycle was not credited-live-verified
# in the approved audit; it is scoped to harness=grok and can never classify
# another adapter. The delivery guards in bin/fm-composer-lib.sh match rendered
# footers for submit acknowledgement and away-mode supervisor injection only;
# neither is a recorded worker state source.
#
# The muse pull source is semantic, not rendered: it folds muse's own durable
# session event log. It has no writer, no arm, and no gen, because
# muse's default build ships no hook or plugin surface that could push events
# (its plugin engine reports "plugins are not available in this build" without
# MUSE_EXPERIMENTAL_PLUGINS). Nothing is armed for muse for the same reason
# standalone Kimi is not: a seeded record with no writer could never be
# cleared. See fm_busy_muse_run_state for the fold.
#
# The cursor pull source works the same way and for the same reason: it folds
# cursor's own durable per-conversation transcript, which brackets each turn
# with a role:user open and a typed turn_ended close that covers aborts. It has
# no writer, no arm, and no gen, so nothing is seeded that could never be
# cleared. See fm_busy_cursor_turn_state for the fold. Cursor's rendered
# `ctrl+c to stop` footer is deliberately not a state source here.
#
# Codex negotiation (fm_busy_codex_appserver_observable,
# fm_busy_codex_hooks_verified): the approved contract prefers Codex's
# app-server turn lifecycle with capability negotiation, and sanctions its
# stable lifecycle hooks as the intermediate. Neither is usable on the
# installed binary, so Codex classifies unknown codex-unverified rather than
# falling back to idle, and fm-spawn installs no Codex busy wiring.
# docs/verification/supervision.md owns the evidence for both probes.
#
# Sourcing: set -u and set -e safe; no subshell-unfriendly globals.

FM_BUSY_LIB_VERSION=v1

# Standalone-Kimi verification gate. Empty means no installed Kimi version
# has passed live verification, so every standalone Kimi task classifies
# unknown kimi-unverified and fm-spawn wires no Kimi busy events. Kimi's
# rendered moon-phase spinner is deliberately NOT a state source here: the
# approved redesign forbids inventing a Kimi UI signature, and that spinner
# is locale- and emoji-font-sensitive.
#
# Preferred source, in order: Wire mode's JSON-RPC `prompt` request lifetime,
# whose outstanding request exactly brackets a turn and returns finished,
# cancelled, or max_steps_reached (so it covers interruption, which `Stop`
# does not); then the documented lifecycle hooks, which must include
# `Interrupt` because Kimi documents that `Stop` does not fire on interrupts.
#
# To open the gate: install Kimi, live-verify the chosen source brackets a
# real turn on a firstmate-launched worker including the interrupt path,
# record the version, exact commands, and observed output in
# docs/verification/supervision.md, add the verified version string(s) here,
# and land the wiring in fm-spawn behind this same gate in the same change.

# muse session-log busy source
#
# muse persists an append-only session event log per session at
# <sessions-root>/YYYY/MM/DD/<session-uuid>/session.jsonl, and brackets every
# submitted turn with one run lifecycle pair. Verified live on muse
# 0.1.0-R708.1 across completed, interrupted, and killed-mid-turn turns:
#   {"payload":{"kind":"run","run_id":"<uuid>","event":{"kind":"started",...
#   {"payload":{"kind":"run","run_id":"<uuid>","event":{"kind":"terminal",
#     "terminal":"completed"|"cancelled",...
# An Escape interrupt closes its run with terminal=cancelled, so unlike Claude's
# Stop hook this source covers the interrupt path itself. Any later
# run_retracted records follow the terminal rather than replacing it.
#
# Both halves of the fold are trusted. An open run is positive proof a turn is
# in flight, and a settled log is idle: the credentialed multi-step smoke showed
# one run pair spans a whole multi-step turn, including an Escape interrupt that
# closes the run with terminal=cancelled instead of continuing the turn in
# another run. This gives the settled log the same idle trust as the Claude and
# Pi push sources. A version allowlist would be false precision and a maintenance
# treadmill for an auto-updating vendor binary: busy classification receives
# only the normalized muse harness identity, while session metadata records
# semver 0.1.0 plus a build SHA that cannot be matched against it. Resolution
# failures - no sidecar, no matching log, an unreadable or run-free log - remain
# unknown because those prove nothing about the turn either way. See
# docs/verification/muse.md for the evidence.
