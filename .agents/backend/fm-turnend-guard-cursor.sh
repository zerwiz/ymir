#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Cursor `stop` hook adapter for a firstmate PRIMARY session: the park model.
#
# Registered in tracked .cursor/hooks.json. Cursor runs this hook SYNCHRONOUSLY
# and awaits it at every turn boundary, so one script owns both halves of Cursor
# primary supervision:
#
#   PARK      while supervision is needed, foreground bin/fm-watch-arm.sh and
#             hold the turn boundary open until the watcher closes with an
#             actionable wake, then return that wake as the follow-up. No model
#             tokens are spent while parked. The next turn end parks again, so
#             the arm/re-arm loop is hook-owned, never model-memory-owned.
#   BACKSTOP  when the park cannot establish supervision, return the shared
#             turn-end guard's repair instruction as a bounded follow-up.
#
# EXIT 2 IS A SILENT NO-OP ON CURSOR'S stop. Cursor's blocked-response mapper
# returns an empty object for the stop step (index.js @ 4823085,
# `e===r.stop ? {} : void 0`), verified live: a stop hook exiting 2 ends the turn
# normally. This adapter therefore NEVER exits 2 and NEVER writes a diagnostic
# banner to stderr expecting it to be read. Every path exits 0 and the only
# channel is at most one {"followup_message": ...} object on stdout.
# docs/turnend-guard.md:16 accepts one bounded follow-up as an equal alternative
# to blocking, which is the same primitive OpenCode's session.idle and Pi's
# agent_settled adapters use.
#
# Follow-up sources, in priority order, at most one per invocation:
#   1. an actionable watcher wake from the park;
#   2. the bounded repair instruction when supervision could not be established.
#
# LOOP BOUNDING IS DOUBLE, because either bound alone is insufficient:
#   - `loop_limit` in .cursor/hooks.json is Cursor's own ceiling. Once
#     loop_count reaches it Cursor stops INVOKING this hook at all, so it is the
#     only bound that still holds if this script is broken or replaced.
#   - FM_CURSOR_TURNEND_LOOP_CEILING bounds the payload's own loop_count from
#     inside, deliberately BELOW the registered loop_limit, so firstmate's bound
#     bites first and can emit one final loud notice instead of going silently
#     dark at Cursor's ceiling.
# `loop_count` is Cursor's richer analogue of Claude/Codex `stop_hook_active`:
# verified live on 2026.08.11-e8db854 as 0 on the first stop after a real user
# message, +1 per follow-up-driven stop, and reset to 0 by the next real user
# message. A genuine wake is productive work, so it does not consume the
# separate repair budget; only consecutive unproductive repair nags do.
#
# SUPERSESSION. A captain message typed while this hook is parked is accepted
# and runs its turn immediately, and Cursor does NOT terminate the parked hook
# (verified live). Until that turn ends and the next stop claims the baton, an
# actionable close can still produce one real, durable-queue-backed follow-up
# from the sole existing park. Each invocation publishes itself as the current
# park owner in state/.cursor-park-owner, and once a newer stop has published its
# claim, an older park still running stands down without emitting. Newest stop
# wins; the arm's own singleton keeps the overlap from starting a second watcher.
#
# PI STAND-DOWN. Exit 0 without parking when PI_CODING_AGENT=true and neither
# CURSOR_AGENT nor CURSOR_INVOKED_AS is set, so a Pi host that loaded
# .cursor/hooks.json via pi-cursor-sdk does not dual-watch against
# fm_watch_arm_pi. Cursor identity keeps parking despite a leaked
# PI_CODING_AGENT. docs/turnend-guard.md owns the contract.
