# bin/fm-backend-hometag-lib.sh - shared per-installation home-tag derivation
# for session-provider backends whose container has ONE namespace shared by
# every firstmate home on the machine, with no native per-home split (cmux's
# one app-global workspace list, zellij's one shared "firstmate" session's
# tab bar). Without a per-home discriminator embedded in the actual
# title/name, two firstmate homes (two secondmates, a primary plus a
# secondmate, or two independent primary installations) whose task ids
# happen to collide can send/peek/close each other's tabs - the gap a
# captain-directed no-mistakes review gate caught for cmux
# (docs/cmux-backend.md) and this same tag mechanism was later ported to
# zellij to close for the same reason (docs/zellij-backend.md "Home-scoped
# tab titles").
#
# fm_backend_hometag() derives a short, stable tag: a readable prefix
# ("firstmate" for the primary home, "2ndmate-<id>" for a secondmate home
# carrying .fm-secondmate-home) plus a short hash of the resolved FM_ROOT
# path, so distinct installations - including multiple primaries on one
# machine - never collide even though they share one backend-global
# namespace. Callers source this file AFTER resolving their own
# FM_HOME/FM_ROOT fallbacks (both adapters already do this for their own
# purposes before any other function runs).
#
# Moving/relocating a firstmate installation changes its FM_ROOT path and
# therefore its tag; titles created under the old tag simply stop matching -
# an accepted limitation, no worse than the existing fact that a task's
# recorded absolute worktree path does not survive a move either.
