# Shared worktree-tangle guard for the firstmate-on-itself case.
# Usage: . bin/fm-tangle-lib.sh
#
# Firstmate is a treehouse-pooled git repo of itself: crewmate worktrees and
# secondmate homes are all linked `git worktree`s of the same repo, while the
# PRIMARY checkout (the repo root firstmate operates from) is a normal checkout
# on a real branch - normally the default branch, main. The "worktree tangle"
# failure mode is a crewmate spawned to work on firstmate ITSELF branching and
# committing in the primary checkout instead of its own disposable worktree,
# stranding the primary on a feature branch (e.g. fm/readme-restructure-d3).
#
# fm_primary_tangle_branch detects exactly that and nothing else: a NAMED,
# non-default branch checked out in the given root. It is deliberately silent for
# every legitimate state - the primary on its default branch, and detached HEAD,
# which is how every linked worktree and secondmate home legitimately sits on the
# default branch. Detached HEAD on the default is fine; a feature branch in a
# primary checkout is the alarm.

# Resolve the default branch name of the git repo at <dir>: prefer origin/HEAD,
# then fall back to a local main/master. Echoes the name, or returns 1.

# If the git checkout at <root> is tangled - on a NAMED branch that is not its

# homes legitimately sit, so they never trip this; only a feature branch checked
