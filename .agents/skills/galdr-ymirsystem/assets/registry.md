# Registry — skills, assets, tools, commands (loaded from AGENTS.md)

AGENTS.md loads this when a task needs the live inventories.

## Skills registry (`.agents/skills/`)

```
skills[3]{name,norse,purpose,path,status}:
  "galdr","Galdr","agent-CLI ergonomics + master builder/maintainer",".agents/skills/galdr-ymirsystem/SKILL.md","live"
  "tyr-check","Tyr","the judge — 10 principles + runtime gates",".agents/skills/tyr-check/SKILL.md","live"
  "brokk-craft","Brokk","the forger — generates Galdr-compliant skills in TOON","(planned) .agents/skills/brokk-craft/SKILL.md","planned"
```

The **canonical, complete** skill index is `.agents/skills/README.md` — read it for
the live set. The two removed legacy skills (`galdr-compliance`, `galdr-crafter`)
are superseded by `tyr-check` and the planned `brokk-craft`; their files are gone.

Loading: auto-load from `.agents/skills/` via `opencode.json` →
`skills.paths: [".agents/skills"]`. Use `skill galdr`, `skill tyr-check`.

## Galdr assets (`.agents/skills/galdr-ymirsystem/assets/`)

```
galdr_assets[6]{path,load_when}:
  "assets/README.md","the full asset routing index"
  "assets/principles.md","the 10 CLI design principles (full doctrine)"
  "assets/norse-naming.md","naming law + full component map"
  "assets/brokk-distro-runtime.md","the runtime spec (home, digest, lock, cron)"
  "assets/harness-integration/","per-harness adapters (opencode, pi, claude, cursor, codex)"
  "assets/runtime-compliance.md","runtime acceptance gates + runnable checklist"
```

Galdr scripts: `scripts/toon-check.py` (TOON validation) and
`scripts/compliance-check.sh` (all gates). Run the latter before claiming done.

## Assets inventory

```
assets[9]{asset,path,purpose}:
  "Eindri profiles",".agents/subagents/*.md","Sindri/Bragi/Huginn role profiles"
  "Build tool categories",".agents/skills/galdr-ymirsystem/assets/build-tool-categories.md","tool categories for synthesis"
  "TOON schemas",".agents/skills/galdr-ymirsystem/schemas/toon-schemas.md","schema types for validation"
  "Compliance requirements",".agents/skills/galdr-ymirsystem/assets/runtime-compliance.md","runtime + Utgard gates"
  "PI boot profile",".agents/skills/galdr-ymirsystem/assets/pi-boot/pi-profile.yml","PI harness profile"
  "PI herdr profile",".agents/skills/galdr-ymirsystem/assets/pi-boot/herdr-profile.toml","pane layout / Þjazi"
  "PI dispatch schema",".agents/skills/galdr-ymirsystem/assets/pi-boot/einherjar-spawn.schema.json","dispatch payload"
  "Templates",".agents/assets/templates/*","PRD, env, system-prompt boilerplate"
  "Tool manifest schema",".agents/assets/schemas/tool_manifest.json","tool manifest"
```

## Tools inventory (`.agents/tools/`)

```
tools[8]{tool,path,purpose,status}:
  "tasks-cli",".agents/tools/bin/tasks-cli","AXI task manager (list/view/create/close), TOON","live"
  "tasks-cli.ts",".agents/tools/tasks-cli.ts","TypeScript source","live"
  "yggdrasil.ts",".agents/tools/yggdrasil.ts","worktree CLI harness","planned"
  "hermes_runner.ts",".agents/tools/hermes_runner.ts","realm agent CLI orchestrator","planned"
  "herder.ts",".agents/tools/herder.ts","terminal multiplexer / pane state tracker","planned"
  "vector_db.ts",".agents/tools/vector_db.ts","vector indexing / RAG search","planned"
  "firebase.ts",".agents/tools/firebase.ts","backend provisioning","planned"
  "supabase.ts",".agents/tools/supabase.ts","DB / edge function setup","planned"
```

Usage: `python3 .agents/tools/bin/tasks-cli <command>`. All tools emit TOON.

## Fleet services (`tools/`, deployed by `bin/fleet/fleet-ensure.sh`)

The heart's offices materialize from `tools/` into `~/.fleet` and rise as user
units joined to `ymir.target` (the auto-boot law). The snotra operator commands
(`snotra-capture.sh`, `snotra-transcribe.sh`, `snotra-detect.sh`,
`snotra-mine.sh`, `snotra-ensure.sh`,
`runes-append.sh`) are copied to `~/.fleet` too, so any seat can run the ear
without a repo checkout on its PATH.

```
fleet[9]{service,source,unit,port,role}:
  "well-mcp","tools/well-mcp/server.ts","well-mcp.service","8317","heart + dev door"
  "ratatoskr","packages/a2a/ratatoskr/server.ts","ratatoskr.service","8301","heart"
  "mill-worker","tools/mill/worker.sh","mill-worker.service","—","heart"
  "embed","(llama-server)","embed.service","8500","heart/forge with the model"
  "cards","(cards-root)","cards.service","8318","all"
  "skills-mcp","packages/mcp/skills/server.mjs","skills-mcp.service","8319","heart + dev"
  "skuld","tools/tickets-mcp/server.mjs","skuld.service","8320","heart"
  "snotra","tools/snotra/server.mjs","snotra.service","8321","heart (read-only minutes)"
  "snotra-detect","systems/snotra/services/ear/snotra-detect.sh","snotra-detect.service","—","CAPABILITY: any seat with a microphone (the ear's watch; never the heart)"
```

## OpenCode commands

```
commands[8]{command,purpose}:
  "/create-plan","create detailed implementation plans iteratively"
  "/fixes-bump","bump version across project files"
  "/fixes-create","create fix note entry"
  "/implement-plan","implement approved plan phase-by-phase"
  "/rules","display/manage coding rules"
  "/standup","generate daily standup entries"
  "/ticket-create","interactive ticket creation"
  "/validate-plan","validate plan before implementation"
```

## Brokk commands — the Eindri wake bridge (control)

```
commands[5]{command,purpose}:
  "bin/agents/eindri-watch.sh","the bridge's door: arm/retire/list/reconcile a when-source per smith (Norns' loom)"
  "bin/agents/eindri-seen.sh","bridge condition: has the smith reported? (report file, or herdr left working)"
  "bin/agents/eindri-acclaim.sh","the push path: file the report/status, mark the ONE shared ledger (bin/agents/eindri-wake-lib.sh), append the durable wake queue + desktop note; the worker's own terminal act"
  "bin/agents/eindri-handoff.sh","the handoff failsafe: sweep undelivered reports/questions into the wake queue, idempotent on the shared ledger (run on re-arm and on the 06:45 cron row)"
  "systems/snotra/services/cron/hall-snapshot.sh","the planning feed: real system state -> public-safe livehall.json for the Óðrerir Hall"
```

## The marketing stack doors (provisionable — one stack, any computer)

`bin/desktop/ymir-marketing-stack.sh up|status|down|doors` stands Mautic + Postiz +
Activepieces (+ optionally Forgejo) on ANY computer — same OSS engines the
server runs, env-driven, ports virtualized, secrets in the home, never inline.
The operator's own server stack (the heart) and the public doors agents reach. The names
below are the SHAPE of that stack, not a fleet: the operator's real hosts live in his home
(`hodd/config/services.yaml`), and a row here reads them from there at run time.

```
marketing_doors[6]{service,door,reach_note}:
  "Mautic (email automation)","<service>.<host> -> the heart 127.0.0.1:8001","list building + campaigns; agent-carved via the local provisioned stack when the public door is closed"
  "Postiz (social publishing)","<service>.<host> -> the heart 127.0.0.1:4007","schedule X/LinkedIn/insta; queue per site"
  "Activepieces (workflow)","<service>.<host> -> the heart 127.0.0.1:8080","event->post flows; meetup booked -> thread scheduled"
  "Forgejo (git · issues · PRs)","<service>.<host> -> the heart 127.0.0.1:3030","the local git forge: issues->PR loop lives here"
  "SearXNG (search)","searxng on the heart","private search for research (Bragi)"
  "Grafana","grafana on the heart :3003","fleet + stack observability"
```

An agent (Bragi for marketing, Sindri for git) provisions the stack locally for
any user with `bin/desktop/ymir-marketing-stack.sh`; the server stack is the Allfather's
live one. Public-door exposure on the server is tunnel-driven (cloudflared) —
mend the door layer on the server, not in the tree.

## Maintaining this

## The smithy's books (critical, and easy to miss)

`apps/smidja-factory/cookbooks/` (9) and `apps/smidja-factory/skills/` (9) are the specification for the
Smíðja: how a run is launched, what a roster is (`roster.yaml`, teams in `stacks:`), how a prompt is
written, how a chain is composed, and what an install needs. They sit **inside an app**, so no inventory
of `bin/` will ever surface them — read them before touching the smithy.
Law: `RULES/36-the-run-is-visible.md` · detail: `assets/smidja.md`.
## Inventory executable classification (2026-11-03)

`bin/gates/inventory.sh` derives executable status from Git index mode `100755`, not host `os.access(X_OK)`. It reads `git ls-files --stage -z` so whitespace in tracked paths is preserved. Directory walks use an explicit relative POSIX path sort key, avoiding Windows case-folded Path ordering. Filesystem permission changes must not alter the generated public register when the index is unchanged.

`tests/test_inventory_git_mode.py` runs the actual generator in a small Git repository, inverts working-tree executable bits without changing index modes, and checks complete output stability, data/tool classification, whitespace paths and case-sensitive row ordering. Run it on Windows and Linux when changing inventory classification. Regenerate the full registers only after all intended source changes are staged.

The generator writes explicit UTF-8 with LF newlines on every host. The real-generator regression asserts LF output on Windows and Linux. Previously generated register data was retained exactly, with Git text normalization changing CRLF to LF only.

## Path-ledger byte matching (2026-11-03)

bin/gates/guards/path-ledger-guard.sh performs its initial recursive grep in LC_ALL=C so invalid UTF-8 in legacy generated catalogs cannot replace a matching line with a binary-file summary. Paired old/new migration records retain their line context; old-only references still fail. tests/test_path_ledger_bytes.py exercises the actual guard against invalid and valid UTF-8 fixtures on Git Bash and Linux without waivers or binary-file exclusions.

## Fix-note coverage for outgoing refs (2026-11-03)

bin/gates/guards/fixes-guard.sh judges every outgoing branch independently. A recorded sibling cannot hide an unrecorded branch, regardless of push order. Tag and deletion pointers remain content-free. A branch tip with no commits absent from already-fetched origin refs is an already-public pointer; every other outgoing branch must add a fix note in its own comparison range. A new unrelated history compares against the empty tree. Manual --check keeps its existing branch/base judgment. tests/test_fixes_guard_refs.py exercises actual Git commit graphs and mixed ref batches without override flags.

## CHANGE LOG

- **2026-11-12** — this document gained a CHANGE LOG section so it carries its history (RULES/06). Its earlier history is its git log; entries are appended below, never rewritten.
