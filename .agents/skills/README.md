# GUNGNIR — Core Operational Skills

Every reusable task becomes a scripted skill here. Skills are validated in Utgard
before registration, and every skill is named for the myth figure whose role
matches its work (Gungnir naming law).

## Registry (`.agents/skills/`)

Every skill has an **owner agent** (`.agents/agents/<name>.md`): the seat Brokk
dispatches for that work. A skill owned by `brokk` means the primary keeps it in
hand — a dedicated seat is added when the work earns one.

```

The control-plane UI guide is not a standalone skill: **hlidskjalf-ui** and its
hall **Óðrerir** (odrerir-hall) are assets under **galdr-ymirsystem** (the master
builder), loaded from `.agents/skills/galdr-ymirsystem/assets/` — see the galdr router.

Not adopted as standalone skills: `firstmate-coding-guidelines` (folded into Galdr),
`firstmate-orca` / `firstmate-codexapp` (backend reference docs only).

## Skill synthesis rules (Gungnir)

1. Gap identified → write the skill doc + script to `.agents/skills/<name>/`.
2. Validate inside an Utgard container.
3. Register it in this index.
4. **Norse-name every new skill** at synthesis: choose the figure whose role
   matches the work and let the skill inherit that name (`<figure>-<what>`).

Governance: `.agents/skills/galdr-ymirsystem/SKILL.md`; adopted-skill provenance is recorded in
`.agents/skills/galdr-ymirsystem/assets/reference-adoption.md`.
