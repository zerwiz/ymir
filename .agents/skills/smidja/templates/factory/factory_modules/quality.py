"""Deterministic lint, typecheck, build, and test blocks.

A known command is not a judgement call. Anything whose invocation you can write
down belongs here as code — it runs in milliseconds, costs nothing, and returns
the same answer every time. Agents are for the parts that need reading and
deciding.

╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  REPLACE THE PLACEHOLDER COMMANDS BELOW.                                     ║
║                                                                              ║
║  Every block ships as an `echo` that exits 0 and announces it is fake. They   ║
║  are placeholders on purpose: a stamped repo has no way to guess your test    ║
║  runner, and a wrong-but-plausible command that silently passes is worse      ║
║  than one that says so out loud.                                             ║
║                                                                              ║
║  For each block you want: swap `_placeholder(...)` for the real argv, e.g.    ║
║      argv=["bun", "test", "apps/web/server.test.ts"]                         ║
║      argv=["uv", "run", "pytest", "-q"]                                      ║
║      argv=["npm", "run", "lint"]                                             ║
║  Delete the blocks you don't need, and drop them from run_quality()'s list.   ║
║                                                                              ║
║  Two rules when you write the real command:                                  ║
║    1. argv LIST, never a shell string — no quoting bugs, no shell injection.  ║
║    2. Call binaries by BARE NAME. These blocks inherit the operator's         ║
║       environment (see utils.operator_env), so `bun`, `uv`, `pytest` resolve  ║
║       exactly as they do in their terminal. Never hard-code an absolute path  ║
║       like /Users/you/.bun/bin/bun — that bakes your machine into the trace.  ║
