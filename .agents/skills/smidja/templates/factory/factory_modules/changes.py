"""Deterministic change capture: what was built, straight from git.

"What changed since main" is not a judgement call — it is two git commands and
a subtraction. So it is code, and an agent is only handed the result. The
capture writes the full diff into `context_handoff/` and returns a ChangeSet;
`as_envelope` adapts that into the one door every agent handoff uses.

The base is resolved, not assumed. Off the base branch the diff covers the
whole branch plus the working tree; on it, the uncommitted tree; and on a clean
tree, the last commit — because "document the work that was just done" still
has an answer right after a chain committed. Whichever it picked rides along in
`BaseRef.reason`, so the trace never leaves you guessing what a diff was
measured against.
