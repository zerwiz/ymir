# Observability Reference

The event schema, the seven SQLite tables, and the polling contract — the one data path is **agents → sqlite → web ui**.

## Two stores, one truth

**Files are the raw record** (`raw_output.jsonl` streams, `envelope.json`, `agent_map.json`); **SQLite (`smidja.db`) is the queryable mirror** the UI reads. `tracer.py` writes both. Losing the db loses nothing that can't be rebuilt from files.

Location comes from `observability.db` in `smidja.config.yaml`, default `smidja/smidja_data/smidja.db` — inside the **target** repo, gitignored.

## Event schema

`tracer.py` emits these types, every one logged against its `smidja_id` **and** `phase_id`:

| Type | Emitted when |
|---|---|
| `phase_start` | a `run.phase(...)` block is entered |
| `agent_start` | a coding agent is spawned or resumed for `ph.call(...)` |
| `tool_call` | a tool (`read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`) returns — **one event per real call**, named `bash: ls -la src`, payload `{tool, tool_call_id, args, result_snippet, ok, duration_ms, agent}` |
| `handoff` | an envelope crosses from one agent to the next |
| `gate_pass` | a gate found no failed checks — payload carries `attempt`, `checks` (the evidence), and an empty `violations` |
| `gate_fail` | a gate found at least one failed check — payload carries `attempt`, `checks`, and `violations` |
| `log` | an explicit `ph.log(...)` from the smidja script |
| `agent_end` | the agent's run completes; envelope parsed or not — payload carries `cost`, `usage` (the per-component breakdown), `context_tokens`, `context_window` |
| `phase_end` | the block exits; carries the resolved status |
| `error` | a raise inside a phase block |

`parent_id` nests spans, so an agent phase expands into its tool-call spans in the UI.

**Spend is itemised per phase.** `agent_end.usage` carries tokens *and* dollars for each component pi reports — `input`, `output`, `cache_read`, `cache_write` — summed across every send the phase made, so a phase that retried on a bad envelope or a failed gate shows what all its attempts cost, not just the last one. The four components sum to `total_tokens`, and their costs sum to `total_cost`; the visualizer's Cost panel renders them as a table you can add up by eye.

`reasoning_tokens` is the thinking share and is **inside** `output_tokens`, not a fifth component — measured across every session on disk, reasoning never exceeds output and the four components always reconcile to the total. It bills at the output rate, so the panel nests it under output rather than adding it. Runs predating the breakdown have no `usage` key at all; the lump `cost` and the event's own `tokens` still stand, and the UI says so rather than rendering zeroes.

**Context is occupancy, not spend.** `events.tokens` and `sessions.total_tokens` bill every turn, so they only grow — an agent that burned 100k tokens may be sitting in a 15k window. `context_tokens` is how full the window actually was when the agent stopped, which is what the visualizer's per-lane Context bar measures against `context_window`.

It is computed the way pi computes it for its own footer and its auto-compaction trigger (`calculateContextTokens` in the coding agent's `core/compaction/compaction.ts`): take the last *valid* assistant turn — skipping `aborted` and `error` turns — and read `usage.totalTokens`, falling back to `input + output + cacheRead + cacheWrite`. Cache reads count; cached prompt is still prompt. `context_window` is the same `contextWindow` pi reads from `~/.pi/agent/models.json`, so `context_tokens / context_window` is the number pi would show. Both are NULL on rows written before the columns existed, and the lane draws no bar rather than a misleading empty one.

Two caveats worth knowing. Pi adds an *estimate* for any messages trailing the last assistant usage; in a batch (`-p`) run the session ends on that message, so the two agree. And if auto-compaction fires as the very last act of a run, the recorded number is the pre-compaction size — pi itself reports `null` in that window rather than guessing.

**Gates record evidence, not just a verdict.** A gate returns one `{item, ok, note}` check per thing it looked at, and `violations` are derived from the failed ones. Both land in `gate_results` (`checks_json` + `violations_json`) and in the `gate_pass`/`gate_fail` payload, so a green gate can answer *what did you verify* — `{"item": "…/plan.md", "ok": true, "note": "exists, 454B"}` — rather than only *did it pass*. Rows written before this existed have `checks_json` NULL; treat that as "no evidence recorded", not "nothing checked".

The gate event payload carries `attempt` too, so the `gate_results` table and the event stream are equivalent sources — a live consumer can group gate results per correction round from events alone, without a second query.

**A `tool_call` is the one event that spans time**, so it fills both `started_at` and `ended_at` on the row — the tool's real start and return. Every other type is a point in time: `started_at` is when it was recorded and `ended_at` stays NULL. Lay tool calls out on a time axis from those columns, never by parsing `payload_json` (`duration_ms` is in the payload too, as pi's own number, but it is a convenience, not the source for layout).

**Streaming is solved by construction.** `agent_pi.py` tails pi's JSONL stdout line by line and the tracer inserts each event into `smidja.db` **while the agent is still working** — never batched at phase end (verified in the first smoke run: tool calls visible mid-run). Everything downstream is a poll → render.

```

**A hung agent emits nothing**, which is exactly when you need its pid: no events, no tokens, no output to read. `processes` is the only table that can answer "what is this run running, and how do I stop it" — `just procs <smidja_id>` lists what is live, `just kill <smidja_id>` stops children before the parent, and both verify the recorded `command` still matches the pid before signalling it. A killed run finalizes its own trace: SIGTERM and SIGINT are turned into `SystemExit` in `session.ensure`, so the session lands on `fail` with its process rows closed instead of reading `running` forever.

**Every agent earns a lane the same way:** a `phases` row with `kind='agent'` and a non-null `owner`, plus its own spans. Manifest agents get this from `run.phase(...)`. An orchestrator subagent spawned via opencode's `task` tool gets it from `agents._materialize_subagent(run, phase, parent_agent, event)`: the `subagent_dispatch` forwarder branch writes that phase row + spans (`phase_start` → `agent_start` → `subagent_dispatch` → `agent_end` → `phase_end`) in the same shape as a manifest agent, so the visualizer draws it as its own lane stacked under the dispatcher. The subagent runs inside the dispatcher's opencode session, so its lane inherits the dispatcher's configured model/coding surface; its live `session_id` and context occupancy are unknown at completion, so they are omitted (no context bar, honest label). **No `agent_sessions` row is written for a dispatch** — that table's key is `(smidja_id, agent)`, so a task-dispatched `scout` must never overwrite a same-named manifest scout. Because the dispatch event is terminal (opencode reports the task *result*), these lanes are written at completion with `started_at` ≈ `ended_at`; the UI's minimum block width keeps them readable. Subagent lane `seq = parent.seq + 1000 + <counter>` (per-run `_subagent_counter` in `runner.py`), so they sort after every manifest phase and never collide.

**Historical runs** (recorded before this fix) can be backfilled with
`python3 scripts/backfill-subagent-lanes.py <smidja.db> [--apply]` — it replays the
same materialization from stored `subagent_dispatch` events (idempotent, backs
up first). It only fingerprints dispatches whose `phase_id` is a manifest phase
(`NOT LIKE '%::%'`), so the backfill's own span events can never cascade.

**Derived, never stored:** phase durations (`ended_at − started_at`), session phase-progress (query `phases` by `smidja_id`), lane layout (`kind` + `owner`).

Phase status invariants: `queued` only for manifest-declared phases not yet entered (dashed in the UI); `running` on enter; only a clean exit writes `success` — agent phases additionally need the envelope parsed and gates green; everything else resolves to `fail`.

## WAL pragmas

Open **every** connection — writer and reader — with:

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;
PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL;
PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000;
```

WAL allows readers during writes. Writers are the tracers of running smidja processes; concurrent writers are fine given one small transaction per event plus `busy_timeout`. The visualizer reads on a readonly connection with exactly one exception: archiving a session (`POST /api/sessions/:smidja_id/archive`) opens a second connection to set `sessions.archived`. That flag is review triage — it says a human has looked at the run — so it is the reader's state living on the row, and no tracer ever writes or reads it.

## Polling contract

**The UI never receives pushes.** No ingest endpoint, no WebSocket, no backfill or dedup logic.

Live view polls on a rowid cursor every `observability.poll_ms` (default 500):

```sql
SELECT ... FROM events WHERE smidja_id = ? AND rowid > ? ORDER BY rowid LIMIT 500;
```

Keep the highest `rowid` returned as the next cursor. History is **the same queries** with filters, lazy-paged as the engineer scrolls or drills in — one mechanism serves both live and past runs, which is why there is no separate replay path.
