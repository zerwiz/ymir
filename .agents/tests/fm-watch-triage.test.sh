#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tests/fm-watch-triage.test.sh - the always-on wake triage built into
# bin/fm-watch.sh and the shared classifier (bin/fm-classify-lib.sh). The watcher
# now absorbs the benign majority of wakes in bash and exits ONLY on an actionable
# wake, so firstmate's LLM re-arms once per actionable event instead of once per
# wake. These tests cover the classifier predicates as pure functions, then drive
# a real fm-watch.sh subprocess to assert the behavioral contract:
# provably-working no-verb wakes absorbed (no exit, no queue entry, suppressor
# advanced, beacon fresh), stopped-crew no-verb wakes surfaced (queue + exit),
# provably-working stale panes absorbed-then-escalated past the threshold,
# terminal-looking stale status lines overridden by an active run, the heartbeat
# backstop fail-safe, and afk coherence (no double-triage while the away-mode
# daemon owns supervision).
#
# Daemon-side classification/injection lives in fm-daemon.test.sh; watcher/lock
# liveness in fm-watcher-lock.test.sh; the durable-queue safety matrix in
# fm-wake-queue.test.sh.

# classify. The busy-turn bound used to be the one stale path that ignored that,
# running the wedge timer under afk and handing the daemon a wake already decorated
# as a possible wedge. That decoration outranks the daemon's own pause verdict, so a
# crew that declared the wait itself was wedge-escalated once per
# FM_STALE_ESCALATE_SECS for as long as the wait lasted, with the escalation count
# climbing into demand-deep-inspection on a pane nobody needed to inspect.
# Phase A pins the handoff: the plain window identity, no wedge timer, no escalation
# counter, and no normal-mode pause bookkeeping (the daemon owns that in away mode).
# Phase B re-arms on the same unchanged pane and pins the one-shot: a second wake
# here is what the climbing ladder looked like. Phase C drives the discriminator
# apart on the SAME afk, busy, over-age pane - lifting the declaration restores the
# wedge escalation, so this is the worker's declaration being honored rather than
# away mode silencing the escalator.

# pane hash re-fires on every poll, and the daemon, which relaunches the watcher
# after each handled wake, is woken in a loop for the whole declared wait. This
# fixture's fake tmux renders a fresh footer on EVERY capture-pane and asserts that
# divergence outright on every re-arm (.hash-<key> moves, .count-<key> never
# climbs), so the one-wake assertion across five silent re-arms cannot pass
# vacuously on a pane that happened to sit still. Round 1 also starts from an
# undeclared wedge timer and escalation count, which the handoff must clear the
# way the normal-mode absorber does, so lifting the declaration later starts the
# wedge path from a fresh timer rather than resuming a stale count.
