# tests/fm-secondmate-lifecycle-e2e.test.sh - the happy-path secondmate operator
# flow, end to end, against one shared world:
#
#   seed -> spawn -> routed send -> backlog handoff -> recovery respawn -> teardown
#
# Each phase asserts the durable contracts the consolidation audit lists, so the
# many former positive unit tests (registry scope/charter/clone/mode, spawn meta,
# bare-window send, recovery respawn, teardown of an empty home, backlog handoff)
# collapse into one lifecycle. The path-boundary safety invariants and the
# lease-specific paths live in fm-secondmate-safety.test.sh.
#
# Coverage anchored here (must not regress):
#   - registry line records scope (from a filled charter brief) and project list
#   - charter is copied into the subhome
#   - remote-backed projects are cloned with their origin URL preserved
#   - a no-mistakes project is initialized (init + doctor) in the NEW subhome clone
#     and the parent project clone is never mutated (no write through a project)
#   - spawn meta records kind=secondmate, home=, and the project list; launch runs
#     in the subhome with the persistent charter and cleared operational overrides
#   - a bare `fm-<id>` send targets the window recorded in THIS home's meta
#   - backlog items move verbatim into the subhome and leave the main backlog
#   - recovery respawns from the durable registry + persistent home
#   - teardown removes meta and the registry route only after removing the home
