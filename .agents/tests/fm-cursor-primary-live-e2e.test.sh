# Opt-in live guard for Cursor Agent CLI as a firstmate PRIMARY.
#
# The Cursor primary integration rests on facts only the real cursor-agent can
# answer: that its `stop` hook is awaited so a park can hold the turn boundary,
# that a returned followup_message genuinely starts another turn, that
# `sessionStart` carries additional_context into model context, that Cursor's own
# process appears in the session-lock ancestry, and that an idle Cursor composer
# can be proven empty so an away-mode escalation can be delivered. A stub can
# only confirm the assumption already written into the stub, so this exercises
# the installed binary end to end.
#
# tests/fm-cursor-primary.test.sh and the Cursor cases in
# tests/fm-tmux-agent-liveness.test.sh are the portable regressions that run
# everywhere; this is the harness-and-credential-gated counterpart. Run it after
# every Cursor upgrade and before trusting refreshed per-harness evidence in
# docs/verification/supervision.md and docs/verification/runtime-backends.md.
#
# Isolation: a throwaway firstmate home under a temp dir, a private tmux socket,
# and a Cursor workspace Cursor has never seen. It never touches the fleet's tmux
# server, never writes a user-scope or global hook, and never runs against a live
# home. Cursor still records its own per-project transcript under
# ~/.cursor/projects/<slug of the temp path>, which is keyed to the throwaway
# path and is the only state left outside the temp dir.
