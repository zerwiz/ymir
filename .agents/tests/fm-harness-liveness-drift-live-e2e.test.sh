# tests/fm-harness-liveness-drift-live-e2e.test.sh - opt-in drift guard proving
# every INSTALLED harness is still classified `alive` by the tmux liveness
# probe (bin/backends/tmux.sh).
#
# Why this file exists: liveness classification depends on how a harness names
# its own process, which is a surface the harness vendor controls and changes
# without notice. Claude Code began reporting its version string as its process
# name and became unattributable, which silently degraded supervision. A
# regression that only a real harness release can cause needs a check that runs
# real harnesses; a stubbed agent cannot see it, and neither can a table of
# names transcribed from a previous release.
#
# Each harness is launched bare, with no prompt, so this consumes no model
# tokens. The launch uses whatever credentials the harness already has; an
# unauthenticated harness still starts its process, which is all the liveness
# probe reads.
#
# Standard CI has no harness binaries or credentials, so this real-harness guard
# is opt-in and on-demand. The portable counterpart in
# tests/fm-tmux-agent-liveness.test.sh pins the classifier logic in CI. Run this
# guard after any harness upgrade and before trusting refreshed evidence.
