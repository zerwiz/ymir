# Behavior tests for remote job workers abandoned by a pruned code root.
#
# The leak this pins: a worker launched from a worktree's own bin/ outlives that
# worktree. Its restart supervisor sits above the serving child, so killing the
# recorded worker pid only makes the supervisor respawn, and nothing else ever
# stops it. Observed 2026-08-07 as 29 workers at ppid 1, 1-2 days old, each
# still appending to a log in a pruned no-mistakes gate worktree.
#
# bin/fm-remote-job-reap-orphans.sh is a machine-wide sweep by design, so these
# cases assert only about their own fixture processes. Any other worker it
# stops during the run had a pruned code root too, which is exactly the
# contract.
