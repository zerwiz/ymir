# Tests for bin/fm-pr-merge.sh: the one path firstmate uses to merge a task's
# PR, which must record pr= and any available pr_head= into the task's meta so
# fm-teardown.sh's landed-check has a PR reference to verify against, even on
# repos with no PR CI where the usual "checks green" fm-pr-check.sh trigger
# never fires.
#
# Matrix:
#   (a) a verified merge records pr= and pr_head=
#   (b) merge is refused when gh-axi pr merge itself fails (no silent success)
#   (c) extra gh-axi pr merge args are forwarded after number and --repo
#   (d) merge is refused before gh-axi when task meta is missing
#   (e) PR URL is parsed to number + --repo for gh-axi (defaults to --squash)
#   (f) malformed PR URL fails fast without calling gh-axi
#   (g) explicit merge method is not overridden by the default --squash
#   (h) repo override args fail fast because the repo comes from the URL,
#       including a bundled short-option cluster that carries -R
#   (i) a GitLab MR URL resolves and merges through glab instead of erroring
#   (j) glab is addressed by the host from the URL, never an assumed one
#   (k) no merge method is imposed on GitLab, so the project's own one applies
#   (l) each pre-merge condition refuses independently, and all of them report
#   (m) a stale recorded pr_head= is reported and the live head is verified
#   (n) an unreadable merge request state refuses rather than merging blind
#   (o) glab or jq absent refuses before any state is recorded
#   (p) --sha in extra GitLab args fails fast, and still forwards on GitHub
#   (q) a GitLab refusal still leaves pr= recorded and the merge poll armed
#   (r) GitHub success is accepted only after the PR is read back as merged
#   (s) an open GitHub PR that is neither merged nor queued fails verification
#   (t) a GitHub PR in the merge queue is reported as queued, not merged
#   (u) a queue-required refusal names the exact compatible retry flags
#   (v) a failed poll setup cannot be reported as a verified GitHub merge
#   (w) a zero-exit queue-required refusal keeps merge semantics unchanged
#   (x) an unreadable outcome after a successful merge call keeps the PR
#       recorded and the merge poll armed
#   (y) agreeing queue rules still produce exact retry flags
#   (z) conflicting queue rules report ambiguous retry guidance
#   (aa) gh-axi remains usable when gh is absent
#   (ab) a landed merge whose fallback outcome read fails keeps its poll armed
#   (ac) a successful merge in a secondmate home reports the landed PR upward
#       once, on the route its parent binding names, and a repeat merge of the
#       same PR does not duplicate that line
#   (ad) a refused or failed merge reports nothing
#   (ae) a successful merge in a main home leaves a durable wake naming the PR
#   (af) a secondmate home with no usable parent binding says so loudly instead
#       of merging in silence
#   (ag) an accepted queued GitHub merge emits nothing and leaves its poll armed
#   (ah) an accepted queued GitLab merge emits nothing and leaves its poll armed
#   (ai) an uncommitted marker retry never loses the durable outcome
#   (aj) distinct merged PRs for a reused task each survive queue deduplication
#   (ak) pr= is already recorded when the forge call that can land the merge runs
#   (al) a failed gh read falls back to the gh-axi view, which can prove a merge
#   (am) a failed merge command still names an outcome read that proves a landed
#       or queued pull request, without masking the forge failure
#   (an) a refusal after a zero-exit merge quotes the forge's own output, marked
#       apart from the wrapper's verdict and never leaked to stdout
#   (ao) a caller-requested auto-merge on a queue-less base refuses and says
#       auto-merge is armed with nothing merged or queued yet
#   (ap) a caller-requested auto-merge whose merge command failed refuses
#       without ever claiming auto-merge was armed
#   (aq) an outcome read that fails after a zero-exit merge still quotes the
#       forge's own output, the only evidence left
#   (ar) auto-merge with the queue's own method that is still unqueued refuses
#       without echoing back the flags just used, and names the next step
#   (as) a caller method the queue does not use still gets exact retry flags
#   (at) an unrecognised queue method still names the queue requirement and
#       guesses no method
#   (au) unreadable branch rules are reported apart from a queue-less base
#   (av) a base branch with no queue rule says nothing about a merge queue
#   (aw) a refusal built on the gh-axi view says the merge queue could not be
#       observed, and judges that view's state like the queue-aware one
