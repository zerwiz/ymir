# The case that matters most is PATH skew: a tool that has already installed its
# newer copy, while PATH still resolves an older one. On 2026-08-20 that exact
# shape broke this fleet. Herdr self-installed 0.8.2 into ~/.local/bin, a version
# manager kept its own 0.8.0 earlier on PATH inside a directory named "latest",
# and every Herdr command then failed on a protocol mismatch. A check that only
# asks "is a newer version published" reports everything up to date and misses
# it, so test_path_skew_is_reported_from_every_copy reproduces the incident and
# asserts the report names the older copy PATH resolves AND the newer copy that
# is already installed. A single `command -v` lookup cannot know the second
# version, so that assertion fails against any build without real per-copy
# probing.
#
# The fixtures use a synthetic command name and their own temporary PATH
# directories, so no case ever probes, launches, or otherwise touches a tool
# actually installed on this host.
