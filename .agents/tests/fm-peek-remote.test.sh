# fm-peek remote-secondmate capture routing.
#
# A remote secondmate's pane lives on its own host. The old path resolved the
# meta's "remote:<id>" window through the local backend adapters and handed it
# to tmux, which failed with "can't find session: remote" - a healthy remote
# mate misreported as an unreadable endpoint. These tests drive the real
# fm-peek + fm-on executables with a stubbed ssh transport (FM_SSH_BIN seam)
# and a poisoned local tmux, pinning:
#   1. A remote selector routes the capture over the remote transport and
#      prints the remote pane tail; the local adapters are never consulted.
#   2. An unreachable host fails loudly naming the host, without claiming the
#      mate is dead.
