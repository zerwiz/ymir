#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tests/fm-backend-cmux-smoke.test.sh - real cmux smoke test for the cmux
# session-provider adapter (bin/backends/cmux.sh), verified against the real
# cmux 0.64.17 binary (docs/cmux-backend.md). Mirrors
# tests/fm-backend-zellij-smoke.test.sh's/fm-backend-herdr-smoke.test.sh's
# structure: every other suite fakes the CLI, this one talks to the REAL app -
# but unlike herdr/zellij there is no isolated throwaway SESSION to spin up:
# cmux is one shared, GUI-first, macOS-only instance (the same posture as
# Orca). So this test creates ONLY `fm-test-`-prefixed task labels, touches and
# closes ONLY what it created, never enumerates-and-closes, never quits or
# relaunches the app, and cleans up every artifact via
# tests/cmux-test-safety.sh's guarded close. The adapter turns those plain
# labels into home-scoped cmux workspace titles internally.
#
# Skips cleanly when cmux (or jq) is not installed/reachable, so CI/dev
# machines without cmux, or without the one-time password-mode setup
# (docs/cmux-backend.md "Setup"), are unaffected.
