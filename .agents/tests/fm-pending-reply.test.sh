# Parent-owned secondmate pending-reply guards (bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh).
#
# Reproduces the missed-report experience: a marked request is delivered, the
# target turn completes, and no correlated parent report arrives. The parent
# must notice without scraping conversation, send exactly one recovery repost,
# and escalate once if that recovery turn is also missed.
#
# Coverage:
#   1. Normal correlated reply resolves once
#   2. Completed turn with no report triggers one recovery only
#   3. Recovery reply resolves the original expectation
#   4. Second missed turn escalates once and remains durable
#   5. Transport success cannot masquerade as reply success
#   6. Unrelated events and stale correlation ids cannot resolve a request
#   7. Restart/compaction preserves the expectation and exact parent destination
#   8. Wrong-home reports are detected but do not silently acknowledge
#   9. Direct unmarked captain input creates no expectation
#  10. fm-send secondmate path embeds corr and creates durable pending records
#  11. Backend busy/idle observation works through the shared busy abstraction
#      used by Pi/Claude secondmate backends (no conversation scrape)
#  12. A remote mate's repost waits for its asynchronous reply mirror to be read
#      past the turn, so a mirrored reply is never nagged and a real miss still
#      gets its one repost
