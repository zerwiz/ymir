# fm-control.sh: the agent lifecycle CONTROL plane.
#
# These tests pin the control plane's observable behavior hermetically - a
# stubbed session provider, no real agent - through the executable interface
# firstmate actually calls:
#   1. Adapter contract: every verified harness gets its own verified exit
#      command and interrupt key, delivered as bytes to the endpoint.
#   2. Backend capability: a backend that cannot deliver the harness's
#      interrupt key, and a backend with no recovery-grade agent-state
#      classifier, both refuse instead of acting blind.
#   3. Exact-id scoping: a window label, an explicit endpoint, an unknown id,
#      and a record bound to another task are all refused.
#   4. Verb allowlist: no arbitrary text, no raw keys, no resume.
#   5. Lifecycle states: busy interrupts first, idle does not, already-stopped
#      is idempotent success, and an agent that does not stop fails closed.
#   6. Marker non-regression: a control command to a kind=secondmate task
#      carries NO from-firstmate marker and opens no pending-reply expectation,
#      while fm-send's marking of the same task is untouched.
