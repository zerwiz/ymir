# Behavior tests for tests/fixtures.sh fake-toolchain and spawn-world builders.
#
# These cases drive the builders as a test would: they write stubs into a
# fakebin and exec those stubs. Assertions are on the binaries' observable
# output, exit status, and files they create - never on fixtures.sh source
# text. Migrated spawn suites cover fm_test_run_spawn through the real
# fm-spawn.sh; this file pins the stubs those suites now share.
