# runner (bin/fm-procevent-when.sh).
#
# Every scenario is exercised through the adapter's public commands plus the
# generic runner, against real condition and action processes; nothing here
# asserts implementation-source bytes. The suite proves the load-bearing
# guarantees: the action fires exactly once on a stable true, never on a flap,
# never twice across a restart, never from a mutated spec, and every failure
# path ends in a captured terminal outcome that reaches the durable wake queue
# instead of a silent retry.
