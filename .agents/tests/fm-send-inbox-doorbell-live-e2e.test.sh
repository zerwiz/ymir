# tests/fm-send-inbox-doorbell-live-e2e.test.sh - the live doorbell guard
# (live-harness-optin family).
#
# The steering inbox's one behavioral assumption is that a real worker agent
# follows the constant self-describing doorbell line: list the inbox, read and
# act on its records in numeric order, then mv each into handled/. A stub can
# only confirm the assumption already
# written into the stub, so per .agents/skills/firstmate-coding-guidelines
# this is proven against every INSTALLED verified harness: each is launched
# idle in an isolated tmux server, steered through the REAL fm-send (durable
# record + doorbell), and must both ACT on the instruction (create a named
# file) and ACKNOWLEDGE it (the mv into handled/), failing loudly with the
# harness name and version.
#
# Run explicitly with FM_SEND_INBOX_LIVE_E2E=1. This test spends a small
# number of real model tokens per installed harness (one short turn each) -
# authorized by the harness-dependent-checks rule. An absent harness is
# reported explicitly and skipped; a run that verified nothing fails rather
# than passing vacuously. Restrict with
# FM_SEND_INBOX_LIVE_HARNESSES="claude codex ..." when needed, and tune the
# per-harness wait with FM_SEND_INBOX_LIVE_TIMEOUT (seconds, default 240).
# Record the dated per-harness result in
# docs/verification/runtime-backends.md ("Steering-inbox doorbell").
#
# Folder trust: harnesses launch with the repo root as cwd, which the
# operator's machine has normally already trusted; a trust dialog is a real
# unready state and correctly fails that harness's check.
