# Tests for the local-HEAD secondmate sync: every secondmate home tracks the
# PRIMARY firstmate checkout's current default-branch commit by a purely LOCAL
# fast-forward (no origin fetch). Two hook points drive it - bin/fm-spawn.sh
# (before launching a secondmate) and bin/fm-bootstrap.sh (a startup sweep of
# every live secondmate home) - and both share the ff machinery in
# bin/fm-ff-lib.sh.
#
# The guarantees under test:
#   - The shared ff helper, driven with a LOCAL commit base, advances a behind
#     home (updated), is a no-op on an already-current home (current, no nudge),
#     and refuses - leaving work untouched - on a dirty, diverged, or
#     in-flight (feature-branch) home.
#   - No origin fetch happens in the local-HEAD sync path.
#   - The bootstrap sweep fast-forwards every live secondmate home and sends a
#     reread nudge ONLY for a running secondmate whose instruction surface
#     actually changed; a successful send is reported as BOOTSTRAP_INFO:, a
#     failed send is reported as NUDGE_SECONDMATES:, an already-current or
#     readme-only home is never nudged, a skipped home is reported as
#     SECONDMATE_SYNC:, and a home with no live metadata is never swept.
#   - Spawning a secondmate fast-forwards its worktree to the primary's HEAD
#     before launch, or warns and launches unchanged when the sync is skipped.
