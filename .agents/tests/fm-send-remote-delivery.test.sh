# fm-send remote-secondmate delivery: the remote inbox leg.
#
# A remote steer is delivered by durable record, never by typing its payload:
# fm-send crosses fm-on.sh to the host-local leg (fm-remote-secondmate-control.sh
# cmd_send), which writes the message idempotently into the remote home's
# steering inbox and rings the remote doorbell best-effort. These tests drive
# the real fm-send + fm-on executables with a stubbed ssh transport that
# EXECUTES the real host-local leg against a seeded remote-home fixture (the
# FM_SSH_BIN seam tests/fm-on.test.sh proves preserves exit status), and pin:
#   1. A remote text steer lands as a durable record in the remote home's
#      steering inbox, marker and corr token in the body, exits 0, and marks
#      the pending-reply expectation delivered at enqueue; a failed doorbell
#      never fails the send.
#   2. Re-running the identical leg is idempotent: an ambiguous transport
#      (executed remotely, then ssh exit 255) makes fm-send retry the same
#      leg once, and the remote inbox holds exactly ONE record afterwards.
#   3. A remote --resolve-key answer closes its decision at enqueue.
#   4. A remote harness-native "/..." steer also rides the inbox: the deleted
#      remote typed-payload plane is gone for every remote text.
#   5. A real remote failure still fails loudly with the remote leg's own
#      stderr and discards the undelivered expectation.
#   6. The deleted exit-3-as-delivered remap is GONE: a nonzero remote leg
#      status is a failure, never reported as delivered.
#   7. Pure transport loss (ssh 255 twice, nothing executed) fails with
#      resend-safe guidance - the deleted "do not resend" trap is gone - and
#      preserves the marked expectation for the record that may have landed.
#   8. A LOCAL typed-plane send (an explicit backend target or harness-native
#      slash) keeps its exit-3 delivered-unconfirmed contract, never closes a
#      --resolve-key decision unconfirmed, and keeps a marked expectation
#      armed.
