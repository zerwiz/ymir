# Every case here runs offline. The three things worth protecting in this feature
# are all offline properties: the frame format the laptop and the desktop agree
# on, WHAT a status answer is allowed to contain, and the fact that real work is
# handed to firstmate rather than done by the voice agent. The latency work that
# motivated the build is a measurement, not an assertion, so it is not here; the
# numbers and the method live in docs/voice-relay.md.
#
# THE CASE THAT MATTERS MOST is the confidentiality boundary. The captain granted
# the voice agent full read access to their records, so the reader defaults to the
# wider scope. What keeps that safe is structural: finished work and free-form
# note bodies are never assembled at all, and those are exactly where commercial
# detail accumulates. This suite plants a marker in both places and fails if it
# ever reaches an answer, so widening the reader later breaks a test instead of
# quietly widening what is sent to a model in another region.
#
# The markers below are invented for this fixture. Real customer names are not
# committed to a test file.

  Long note body written for someone with the whole file open, mentioning

- [ ] beta-two - Decide the storage shape (repo: beta) (kind: captain) (priority: 1)
- [ ] gamma-three - Migrate the $DENY_TOKEN account onto the new plan (repo: gamma) (kind: ship)

## Queued
- [ ] delta-four - Add the retry (repo: delta) (kind: ship) (hold-kind: captain) (hold: waiting on the captain)
- [ ] epsilon-five - Tidy the logs (repo: epsilon) (kind: ship)

## Done
- [x] old-six - Shipped the $NEVER_TOKEN integration (repo: alpha) (done 2026-07-01)
# An unticked line under Done, held for the captain. Two separate mechanisms keep
# finished work out of an answer: the section is never parsed, and a ticked box is
# dropped. A ticked line is blocked by both, so it cannot tell which one broke.
# This line is blocked by the section rule alone, and the list of what waits on
# the captain is assembled with no section filter at all, so it is the one place
# where losing that rule would put finished work into a spoken answer.

# --- the whole round trip ----------------------------------------------------
#
# Every case above holds one piece of the spoken interface still. This one runs
# the piece the captain experiences: the laptop client opens the transport, the
# relay answers a spoken question from the records and hands a spoken request for
# real work to firstmate, and the reply audio and the timing come back down the
# same stream. It is the only case that would notice the round trip stopping
# working while all of the pieces still passed.
#
# ONE thing is stood in for: the model. It is a paid service in another region
# and no test has a credential for it. The stand-in below speaks the same event
# protocol Nova Sonic does and composes what it says out of the tool results the
# relay actually hands it, so the words asserted here are the records rather than
# a script, and it records what the session was opened with so this case can
# check the account and the model the relay chose. Everything else is real: the
# client, the frame format, the relay, the reader and bin/fm-inbox.sh.
#
# What only this case can hold:
#   the round trip completes at all, in both of its shapes, a status answer and a
#   handover, and a second turn is not treated as an interruption of the first;
#   the headline figure is measured from the captain's talk end rather than from
#   the start of their speech, which on this clip is the difference between half
#   a second and two and a half;
#   the talk-end silence padding really is sent, which is trap 2 and the
#   difference between an answer and no answer;
#   the laptop needs no AWS credential: the client runs with an environment that
#   has none, and the session is opened with the key only the desktop side holds.

"""A scripted stand-in for Nova Sonic's bidirectional stream.

It answers with what the relay's own tool results contain, so a spoken answer
here is derived from firstmate's records rather than from a fixture string, and
it appends one JSON line per session describing what that session was opened
with and what it was asked. tests/fm-voice-relay.test.sh reads that record.

  FM_FAKE_SCRIPT   comma-separated turn kinds: status | handover | clean-end
  FM_FAKE_THINK    seconds before the reply begins, standing in for the model
  FM_FAKE_STATE    file holding the turn counter across the relay's reconnects
  FM_FAKE_LOG      where to append the per-session record
  FM_FAKE_REQUEST  the words the captain uses when asking for real work
  FM_FAKE_EARLY    1 to answer from the first audio in, not from the talk end

A clean-end turn is a session the model finishes with while the captain is still
speaking: the output stream simply ends, with no error and no answer. That is an
ordinary end of a Bedrock session rather than a fault, and the relay has to
survive it, so it is a turn kind here rather than a failure injection.

FM_FAKE_EARLY stands in for the model's own end-of-speech detector firing inside
a clip that already ends in silence: the answer begins before this end of the
stream has said the turn is over. Nova Sonic really does that, and the relay's
own timing figures are negative when it happens, which is the one case where a
fast-looking number is meaningless.

# --- a model session that ends while the captain is still talking ------------
#
# A Bedrock session ending is not a fault. The stream simply stops: no exception,
# no stop reason, nothing to report. It can happen mid-conversation, and when it
# does the captain is usually still holding the talk key, because that is when
# the relay is talking to the model at all.
#
# The relay used to treat that as its own reason to stop, which is the worst
# available failure shape: the relay dies without saying anything the captain can
# act on, and they find out by speaking a whole question into nothing and getting
# no answer. Per-turn reconnect already covers this - the next talk key builds a
# new session, at a measured cost of 0.02 s - and a reconnect that cannot be made
# is spoken to the captain through the turn-failed path. So the session ending
# costs them the remainder of one key press, and nothing else.
#
# This case is the round trip above with one difference: the model finishes with
# the first session 300 ms into a two second key press. What it holds is that the
# relay is still serving afterwards and that the NEXT talk key gets a working
# session rather than a closed pipe - a real answer, out of the real records, over
# the same connection. The relay may exit for three reasons and this is not one of
# them.

# `fm-voice-relay.py --self-test <clip.pcm>` is what docs/voice-relay.md tells the
# captain to run before they touch the laptop, and it is also the instrument the
# direct column of the latency table was measured with. Everything above drives
# the relay through the client; this drives the desktop check itself, because a
# broken --self-test is a captain who cannot tell a configured desktop from an
# unconfigured one, and a number in a table that nobody can reproduce.
#
# The second case is the one worth having. A clip that already ends in silence
# makes the model answer before this end of the stream has said the turn is over,
# so every figure is measured from the wrong instant and comes out negative. The
# reply really is fast and the number really is meaningless, which is the worst
# combination to leave in a results file for someone who was not here. The guard
# has to name the marks and say why, not print the figure.
