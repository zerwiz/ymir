# tests/fm-classify-decision-key.test.sh - decision-key position tolerance in
# the open-decisions fold (bin/fm-classify-lib.sh). A "[key=<slug>]" token is
# documented between the verb and the colon (needs-decision [key=x]: note), but
# workers commonly write the colon first (needs-decision: [key=x] note); that
# stated key must be honored, never silently folded into the shared "default"
# bucket where an answer can close the wrong record (issue #2109). Also covers
# status_line_verb's bracket-tag stripping: a remote secondmate reply prepends
# a "[corr=...]" correlation tag before (or without) "[key=...]", and every
# such tag before the colon must be stripped so the leading word is the bare
# verb, regardless of order or count. These tests drive the REAL
# status_line_verb / status_open_decisions / status_open_decisions_incremental
# functions over crafted status files and assert their folded output, never the
# fold's own source text. Also covers status_key_closing_verb, which reports how
# the status side currently reads one key so a consumer can tell a settled key
# from one handed to a durable captain-held task (bin/fm-captain-hold.sh
# diverged). Cross-drain cursor persistence and the incremental
# cost bound live in tests/fm-wake-drain-open-decisions-cursor.test.sh; the
# drain wiring lives in tests/fm-wake-drain-open-decisions.test.sh.
