# tests/fm-backend-tmux-smoke.test.sh's structure: every other suite fakes the

# captain's real herdr usage. Skips cleanly when herdr (or jq) is not
# installed, so CI/dev machines without herdr are unaffected.

# Safety (2026-07-02 incident, see tests/herdr-test-safety.sh): cleanup uses
# ONLY herdr_safe_stop_and_delete, never a bare/ambient `herdr server stop` -
# that command killed the captain's live default herdr server twice in
# production because HERDR_SESSION-based targeting (env var OR inline prefix)
# is not reliably honored once another herdr server is already running.
