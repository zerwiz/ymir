# Subsystem docs — the book to read before you touch a path

> Written 2026-10-23 after a night of missed critical information: the authoritative documentation for
> several subsystems lives **inside an app** (`apps/*/SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `cookbooks/`, `skills/`,
> `docs/`, `references/`), so no inventory of `bin/` will ever surface it, and nothing in the contract
> sent a hand to it. Twice in one night a claim was made from the tree that the subsystem's own book
> contradicted.

**Ask the door, do not remember:** `bin/records/where.sh <path or topic>`.

**A `missing` cell is a fact, not a footnote:** the book names a door or a file that this tree does not
have. That is a ticket (`hodd/docs/tickets/`), never a reason to improvise the thing the book describes.
