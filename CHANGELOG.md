## 2026-09-11 — Gleipnir lock PID binding fix

- **Problem:** The session lock (`state/.lock`) was written with the digest
  helper's PID (a short-lived child) instead of the live Pi harness PID. The
  harness adapter (`gna-pi-watch.ts`) reported "no live session holds the lock"
  and refused to arm the watcher.
- **Root cause:** `BROKK_SESSION_PID` was never injected into the spawn chain.
  `gleipnir_lock_acquire` fell back to `$$` (helper PID).
- **Fix:** `.pi/extensions/syn-turnend-guard.ts` and
  `.pi/extensions/gna-pi-watch.ts` now pass `BROKK_SESSION_PID: String(process.pid)`
  in the spawn env, so the lock binds to the live Pi process.
- **Impact:** Session lock reclamation works on next Pi session start/reload.
  The stale lock (dead PID) is overwritten by the live PID.
